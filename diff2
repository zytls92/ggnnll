                               CHAPTER I$
$
$
IT was two hours after the muezzin had called to evening prayer, and$
night had canopied Tangier with a million stars. In the little Sok, the$
bread-sellers sat cross-legged behind their wares, their candles burning$
steadily, for there was not so much as the whisper of a wind blowing.$
The monotonous strumming of a guitar from a Moorish cafM-CM-), the agonised$
_barlak!_ of a belated donkey-driver bringing his charge down the steep$
streets which lead to the big bazaar, the shuffle of bare feet on$
TangierM-bM-^@M-^Ys cobbles, and the distant hush-hush of the rollers breaking$
upon the amber shoreM-bM-^@M-^Tthese were the only sounds which the night held.$
$
John Maxell sat outside the Continental CafM-CM-), in the condition of bodily$
content which a good dinner induces. Mental content should have$
accompanied such a condition, but even the memory of a perfect dinner$
could not wholly obliterate a certain uneasiness of mind. He had been$
uneasy when he came to Tangier, and his journey through France and Spain$
had been accompanied by certain apprehensions and doubts which$
Cartwright had by no means dispelled.$
$
Rather, by his jovial evasions, his cheery optimism, and at times his$
little irritable outbreaks of temper, he had given the eminent KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
Counsel further cause for disquiet.$
$
Cartwright sat at the other side of the table, and was unusually quiet.$
This was a circumstance which was by no means displeasing to Maxell, for$
the night was not conducive to talk. There are in Northern Africa many$
nights like this, when one wishes to sit in dead silence and let thought$
take its own course, unchecked and untrammelled. In Morocco such nights$
are common and, anyway, Maxell had always found it difficult to discuss$
business matters after dinner.$
$
Cartwright had no temperament and his quiet was due to other causes. It$
was he who broke the silence, knocking out his pipe on the iron-topped$
table with a clang which jarred his more sensitive companion to the very$
spine.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd stake my life and my soul on there being a reef,M-bM-^@M-^] he said with a$
suddenness which was almost as jarring. M-bM-^@M-^\Why, youM-bM-^@M-^Yve seen the outcrop$
for yourself, and isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it exactly the same formation as you see on the$
Rand?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell nodded.$
$
Though a common-law man, he had been associated in mining cases and had$
made a very careful study of the whole problem of gold extraction.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It looks right enough to me,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but as against that we have the$
fact that some clever engineers have spent a great deal of time and$
money trying to locate the reef. That there is gold in Morocco everybody$
knows, and I should say, Cartwright, that you are right. But where is$
the reef? It would cost a fortune to bore, even though we had the other$
borings to guide us.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The other made an impatient noise.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course, if the reef were all mapped out it would be a simple matter,$
but then we shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt get on to it, as we are to-day, at the cost of a$
few thousands. Hang it all, Maxell, weM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to take a certain amount$
of risk! I know itM-bM-^@M-^Ys a gamble quite as well as you. ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
arguing that point with me. But other things are gambles too. Law was a$
gamble to you for many years, and a bigger gamble after you took silk.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This was a sore point with Maxell, as the other knew. A prosperous$
junior, he had been called within the Bar, and taken upon himself the$
function and style of KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys Counsellor in the hope that his prosperity$
would still further be expanded. And, like so many other men, he had$
discovered that the successful junior is not necessarily the successful$
K.C.$
$
Fortunately for him, he had long before contested and won a seat in$
Parliament, and his service to the Government of the day had to some$
extent ensured his future. But, financially, he had suffered$
considerably.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\silk isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt any great catch to a man, I agree; and it was$
certainly a gamble, and a losing gamble.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Which reminds me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, M-bM-^@M-^\there was a talk, before I left$
London, that you would be given Cabinet rank.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is extremely unlikely,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Anyway, if they make me$
Solicitor-General, that doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt carry Cabinet rank.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It carries a lot of money,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright after a pause for a moment,$
M-bM-^@M-^\and itM-bM-^@M-^Ys money that counts just now, Maxell.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Again the lawyer nodded.$
$
He might have added that, but for the need for money, he would long$
since have dropped his association with Alfred Cartwright, though$
CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys name stood very high in certain circles of the City of$
London. They had been at school together, though in that period there$
had been no very great friendship between them. And Cartwright was$
marked out for success from the beginning. He inherited a considerable$
business when his father died, and he enlarged and improved upon it. He$
had taken up a hundred and one outside interests, and had made most of$
them pay. A few of them did not pay, and it was whispered that the$
losses upon his failures took a considerable slice of the balance that$
accrued from his successes.$
$
They had met again when Maxell was a junior and Cartwright the defendant$
in a case which, had he lost, would have made him some thirty thousand$
pounds the poorer. When Maxell thought back upon that event, he had to$
confess that it was not a pleasant case, being one in which Cartwright$
had been charged with something which was tantamount to$
misrepresentation; and, although he had won, and won brilliantly, he had$
never felt any great pride in his achievement.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] he said (the pauses were frequent and long), M-bM-^@M-^\I should hardly$
imagine that the Prime Minister loves me to that extent. In Parliament$
you have to be an uncomfortable quantity to be really successful. You$
must be strong enough to have a national following, and sufficiently$
independent to keep the Whips guessing. I am known as a safe man, and I$
hold a safe seat, which I couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt lose if I tried. That doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt make$
for promotion. Of course, I could have had an Under-Secretaryship for$
the asking, and that means a couple of thousand a year, but it also$
means that you last out the life of the administration in a subordinate$
capacity, and that, by the time you have made good, your party is in the$
cold shade of opposition, and there are no jobs going.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He shook his head, and returned immediately to the question of the$
missing reef, as though he wished to take the subject from his own$
personal affairs.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You say that it would cost us a lot of money if the reef was proved,M-bM-^@M-^]$
he said. M-bM-^@M-^\IsnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it costing us a lot now?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright hesitated.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, it is. As a matter of fact,M-bM-^@M-^] he confessed, M-bM-^@M-^\the actual reef is$
costing nothing, or next to nothing, because El Mograb is helping me. In$
our own businessM-bM-^@M-^Tthat is to say, in the SyndicateM-bM-^@M-^Tour expenses are$
more or less small; but I am doing a little independent buying, and that$
has meant the spending of money. I am taking up all the ground to the$
south of the AngeraM-bM-^@M-^Ta pretty expensive business.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell shifted uneasily in his chair.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is rather worrying me, you know, Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] he said; M-bM-^@M-^\your$
scheme is ever so much too ambitious. I was figuring it out this$
afternoon as I was sitting in my room, and I came to the conclusion$
that, if the scheme as you outlined it to me yesterday went through, it$
would mean your finding two millions.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Three,M-bM-^@M-^] corrected the other cheerfully, M-bM-^@M-^\but think what it means,$
Maxell! Supposing it went through. Supposing we struck a reef, and the$
reef continued, as I believe it will, through the country I am taking$
up! Why, it may mean a hundred millions to me!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The other sighed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have reached the point where I think a hundred thousand is an$
enormous sum,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\However, you know your own business best,$
Cartwright. But I want to be satisfied in the matter in which we are$
associated together, that my liability does not exceed my power to pay.$
And there is another matter.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright guessed the M-bM-^@M-^\other matter.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I was looking over your titles this afternoon,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, M-bM-^@M-^\and I see$
no reference to the old Spanish working. I remember that you told me a$
Spaniard had taken up a considerable stretch of country and had$
exhausted his capital trying to prove the reefM-bM-^@M-^TSeM-CM-1or Brigot, wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
that his name?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The other nodded curtly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A drunkardM-bM-^@M-^Tand a bad lot,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys broke.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\His moral character doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt count so far as the details go; what does$
matter is that if your theory is correct, the reef must run through his$
property. What are you going to do about that?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Buy him out,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other.$
$
He rose abruptly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym walking up to the Sok,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Come along?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They tramped up the long, steep hill-street together, and they did not$
speak till they had passed through the ancient gate into the unrelieved$
gloom which lies outside the city.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt understand you, MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Tyou take an old manM-bM-^@M-^Ys view of things,M-bM-^@M-^]$
said Cartwright irritably. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre comparatively young, youM-bM-^@M-^Yre a$
good-looker. Why the devil donM-bM-^@M-^Yt you marry, and marry money?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Have you ever tried to marry money?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked dryly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other after a pause, M-bM-^@M-^\but I should think it is pretty$
simple.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Try it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the laconic Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\It is simple in books, but in real$
life it is next to impossible. I go about a great deal in society of all$
kinds, and I can tell you that I have never yet met an eligible spinster$
with moneyM-bM-^@M-^Tthat is to say, large money. I agree with you,M-bM-^@M-^] he went on$
after a while, M-bM-^@M-^\a man like myself should marry. And he should marry$
well. I could give a woman a good position, but sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys got to be the$
right kind of woman. There are some times when IM-bM-^@M-^Ym just frantic about my$
position. I am getting olderM-bM-^@M-^TI am forty-seven next birthdayM-bM-^@M-^Tand every$
day that slips past is a day lost. I ought to be married, but I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
afford a wife. It is a blackguardly thing to talk about money in$
connection with marriage and yet somehow I can think of nothing$
elseM-bM-^@M-^Twhenever the thought arises in my mind I see an imaginary beauty$
sitting on a big bag of gold!M-bM-^@M-^] He chuckled to himself. M-bM-^@M-^\LetM-bM-^@M-^Ys go back,M-bM-^@M-^]$
he said, M-bM-^@M-^\the big Sok always gives me the creeps.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Something lumbered past him in the darkness, some big, overpowering$
beast with an unpleasant smell, and a guttural voice cried in Arabic:$
M-bM-^@M-^\Beware!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Camels!M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright briefly. M-bM-^@M-^\TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yre bringing in the stuff for$
the morning market. The nightM-bM-^@M-^Ys young yet, Maxell. Let us go up to the$
theatre.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The theatre?M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt even know the theatre was open.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is called theatre by courtesy,M-bM-^@M-^] explained Cartwright; M-bM-^@M-^\the$
inhabitants refer to it as the circus. ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a big wooden place on the$
sea edgeM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know it, I know it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\What is being played? The only$
people I have ever seen there have been Spanish artistesM-bM-^@M-^Tand pretty bad$
artistes, too.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a treat for you. It is an English company, or rather, a$
variety company with a number of English turns,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\We$
might do worseM-bM-^@M-^Tat least, I might,M-bM-^@M-^] he added ominously.$
$
When they reached the theatre they found it sparsely filled. Cartwright$
took one of the open boxes, and his companion settled himself into a$
corner to smoke. The turns were of the kind which are usually to be met$
with on the Levant; a tawdrily attired lady sang a humorous song in$
Spanish, the humour being frankly indecent. There were a juggler and a$
man with performing dogs, and then M-bM-^@M-^\Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGradyM-bM-^@M-^] was announced.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\English,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, turning to the programme.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She may even be Irish,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell dryly.$
$
The wheezy little orchestra played a few bars and the girl came on. She$
was prettyM-bM-^@M-^Tthere was no doubt about thatM-bM-^@M-^Tand of a prettiness which$
satisfied both men. She was also British or American, for the song she$
sang was in a French with which both men were familiar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is horrible to see an English girl in a place like this and in such$
company,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
$
Cartwright nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wonder where sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys staying,M-bM-^@M-^] he asked, half to himself, and a$
contemptuous little smile curled MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys lips.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are you going to rescue her from her infamous surroundings?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked,$
and Cartwright snapped round on him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wish to heaven you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic, Maxell. ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys twice this$
eveningM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sorry,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other, snicking off the ash of his cigar. M-bM-^@M-^\I am in a$
cynical mood to-night.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He raised his hands to applaud the girl as she bowed herself from the$
stage, and glanced round the house. Three boxes away was a small party$
of men, whom he judged were the sons of prosperous members of the$
Spanish colony. Their fingers flashed with diamonds, their cigarettes$
burnt from jewelled holders. Cartwright followed the direction of the$
otherM-bM-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SheM-bM-^@M-^Ys made a hit, that Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\These fellows will be$
tumbling over one another to present her with verbal bouquets. I wonder$
where she lives!M-bM-^@M-^] he said again.$
$
Presently the young men rose in a body and left the box, and Cartwright$
grinned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you mind hanging on here whilst I go outside?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not a bit,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other. M-bM-^@M-^\Where are you off to? To find out where$
she lives?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There you go again,M-bM-^@M-^] grumbled Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\I think Tangier makes you$
liverish.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
When he had got to the promenade, the men had disappeared, but a$
question directed to the head attendant revealed, as he had expected,$
the objective of the little party at the stage door.$
$
The stage door was reached from the outside of the theatre and involved$
a journey over rubble and brick heaps. Presently he came to an open$
doorway, where sat a solitary half-caste smoking a pipe and reading an$
old _Heraldo_.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, _hombre_,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright in Spanish, M-bM-^@M-^\have you seen my three$
friends come in here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, SeM-CM-1or,M-bM-^@M-^] nodded the man; M-bM-^@M-^\they have just entered.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He indicated the direction, which lay through a dark and smelly passage.$
$
Cartwright walked along this stuffy hallway, and, turning the corner,$
came upon an interesting group gathered about a closed door, against$
which one, and the least sober, of the party was hammering. Near by$
stood a small, stout man in soiled evening dress, grinning his approval,$
and it was clear that the visitors were at once known and welcome.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Open the door, my dream of joy,M-bM-^@M-^] hiccupped the young man, hammering at$
the panel. M-bM-^@M-^\We have come to bring you homage and adorationM-bM-^@M-^Ttell her to$
open the door, Jose,M-bM-^@M-^] he addressed the manager of TangierM-bM-^@M-^Ys theatre, and$
the small man minced forward and spoke in English.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is all right, my dear. Some friends of mine wish to see you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
A voice inside, which Cartwright recognised, answered:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will not see them. Tell them to go away.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You hear?M-bM-^@M-^] said the manager, shrugging his shoulders. M-bM-^@M-^\She will not see$
you. Now go back to your seats and let me persuade her.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SeM-CM-1or!M-bM-^@M-^] He raised his eyebrows to the unexpected apparition of$
Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\What are you doing here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have come to see my friend,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, M-bM-^@M-^\Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is forbidden to enter the theatre through the saloon of artistes,M-bM-^@M-^]$
said the small man pompously. M-bM-^@M-^\If Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady is your friend, you must$
wait for her until the performance is over.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright took no notice. He was a tall man of athletic build and$
shouldering his way past the others with no difficulty, he tapped on the$
panel.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\here is an English visitor wants to see you!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\English?M-bM-^@M-^] said the voice. M-bM-^@M-^\Come in for the love of Mike!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The door was opened, and a girl with a silk kimono pulled over her stage$
dress, offered him a smiling welcome. The young Spaniard who had been$
hammering on the panel of the door would have followed, but CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
arm barred him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you want this fellow?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do I want himM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] said Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady bitterly, M-bM-^@M-^\do I want the scarlet$
fever or measles? You bet I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want him. HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys been pestering me ever$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you hear what the lady says?M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, speaking in Spanish.$
M-bM-^@M-^\She does not desire your acquaintance.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My father owns this theatre,M-bM-^@M-^] said the young man loudly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then heM-bM-^@M-^Ys got a rotten property,M-bM-^@M-^] replied the calm Cartwright.$
$
The Spaniard turned in a rage to his soiled satellite.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You will put this man out at once, Jose, or there will be trouble for$
you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The little man shrugged his helplessness.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said in English, M-bM-^@M-^\you see my unhappy position. The seM-CM-1or is$
the son of my proprietor and it will be bad for me if you stay. I ask$
you as a friend and caballero to go at once and spare me misfortune.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright looked at the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Must you go on again in this infernal place?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
She nodded, laughter and admiration in her eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What happens if you chuck this infernal job?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym fired,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve a ten weeksM-bM-^@M-^Y contract with these$
people.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you get?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Two hundred and fifty pesetas a week,M-bM-^@M-^] she said contemptuously. M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a$
wonderful salary, isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How many more weeks have you to go before your contract is finished?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Another four,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\weM-bM-^@M-^Yre playing in Cadiz next week, in Seville$
the week after, then Malaga, then Granada.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you like it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Like it!M-bM-^@M-^] the scorn in her voice was her answer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The dresses belong to the troupe, I guess,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Get into your$
street clothes and IM-bM-^@M-^Yll wait for you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What are you going to do?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked, eyeing him narrowly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll make good your lost contract,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He shrugged his shoulders.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like to see an English girlM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Irish,M-bM-^@M-^] she corrected.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I mean Irish,M-bM-^@M-^] he laughed. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like to see an Irish girl doing$
this kind of thing with a lot of horrible half-breeds. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve talent$
enough for London or Paris. What about Paris? I know any number of$
people there.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Could you get me a good engagement?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked eagerly.$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys your name, anyway?M-bM-^@M-^] she demanded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Never mind about my name. Smith, Brown, Jones, RobinsonM-bM-^@M-^Tanything you$
like.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was the agitated little manager who interfered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\you must not persuade this lady to leave the theatre. I$
have her under heavy penalties. I can bring her before the judgeM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now just forget that!M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, M-bM-^@M-^\there is no judge in Tangier.$
She is a British subject, and the most you can do is to take her before$
the British Consul.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\When she returns to SpainM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] said the little man growing apoplectic.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She will not return to Spain. She will go to Gibraltar if she goes$
anywhere,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, M-bM-^@M-^\and from Gibraltar she will be on the sea$
until she reaches a British port.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will go to the Spanish Consul,M-bM-^@M-^] screamed the little manager, clawing$
the air. M-bM-^@M-^\I will not be robbed. You shall not interfere with my$
business, youM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Much of this, thought Cartwright, was intended for the glowering young$
Spaniard who stood in the background. He went outside, closed the door$
and stood with his back toward it. On a whispered instruction from his$
employerM-bM-^@M-^Ys son, whose hands were now flickering fire as he gesticulated$
in his excitement, Jose the manager disappeared, and returned a few$
minutes later with two stalwart stage hands.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Will you leave this theatre at once and quietly?M-bM-^@M-^] demanded the foaming$
manager.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will not leave the theatre until I am ready,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, M-bM-^@M-^\and$
if I leave otherwise, I shall certainly not leave quietly.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The manager stood back with a melodramatic gesture.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Eject the caballero,M-bM-^@M-^] he said finely.$
$
The two men hesitated. Then one came forward.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The seM-CM-1or must leave,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In good time, my friend,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
$
A hand gripped his arm, but instantly he had shaken free, and had driven$
with all his strength at the manM-bM-^@M-^Ys jaw. The stage hand dropped like a$
log. He pushed at the door behind him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Put your kimono over your things,M-bM-^@M-^] he said quickly. M-bM-^@M-^\You can send the$
stage kit back to-morrow. There is going to be a rough house.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\All right,M-bM-^@M-^] said a voice behind him, and the girl slipped out, still in$
her kimono and carrying a bundle of clothes under her arm.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You know the way out? IM-bM-^@M-^Yll follow you. Now, Jose,M-bM-^@M-^] he said flippantly,$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym goingM-bM-^@M-^Tquietly.M-bM-^@M-^]$

                               CHAPTER II$
$
$
HE left behind him a pandemonium of sound and a scintillation of$
flickering diamonds. He found the girl waiting for him in the darkness.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Br-r-r! ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys cold!M-bM-^@M-^] she shivered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where are you staying?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\At the little hotel opposite the British Consulate,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\It$
isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt much of a place, but it was the only room I could getM-bM-^@M-^Tat the$
price.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yd better not go there,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll send for your boxes in the$
morning. Give me those clothes.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He took them from her and put them under his arm, and she fell in by his$
side.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I am glad to be out of it,M-bM-^@M-^] she said breathlessly, taking his arm;$
M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys a dogM-bM-^@M-^Ys life. I was going to quit to-morrow. Those boys have been$
following me round ever since I came to Tangier. I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt think IM-bM-^@M-^Yd$
better go back to my hotel, anyway,M-bM-^@M-^] she said after a moment; M-bM-^@M-^\theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre a$
pretty tough crowd, these Spaniards, and though I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt understand their$
beastly language, I know just what kind of happy holiday theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre$
planning for me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They were in the town, passing up the street of the mosque, when she$
asked him:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where are you taking me?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\To the Continental,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Like this?M-bM-^@M-^] she said in dismay, and he laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have an office in this street,M-bM-^@M-^] he said; M-bM-^@M-^\you can go in and dress.$
IM-bM-^@M-^Yll wait for you outside.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He showed her into the tiny room which served as the headquarters of the$
Angera Gold Mining Syndicate, and sat on the irregular stone steps,$
waiting until she was dressed. Presently she came out, a presentable and$
an attractive figure.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have just thought,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\that you had better to go the$
CentralM-bM-^@M-^TI am staying at the Continental and it wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt look nice.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been thinking something of the sort myself,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\What about$
my broken engagement? Were you joking when you said you would pay? I$
hate talking about money, but I am brokeM-bM-^@M-^TJose owes me a weekM-bM-^@M-^Ys salary.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll make good the money to-morrow,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I can give you a tenner$
now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is the idea?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked him again. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve read a lot of books, and$
I know the knight errant business backwards. You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt strike me as$
being a something-for-nothing man.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not,M-bM-^@M-^] he said coolly. M-bM-^@M-^\It occurred to me when I saw you on the$
stage, that you might be useful. I want a person in Paris I can$
trustM-bM-^@M-^Tsomebody who could look after my interests.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not a business woman,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quickly. M-bM-^@M-^\I hate business.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Business is done by men,M-bM-^@M-^] said he significantly. M-bM-^@M-^\And there are a few$
men I want you to keep track of. Do you understand that?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I see,M-bM-^@M-^] she said at last. M-bM-^@M-^\It is better than I thought.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He did not trouble to ask her what she had thought, or what she imagined$
he had planned, but saw her into the hotel, arranged for a room, and$
walked slowly back to the Continental. He was in the vestibule of that$
hotel before he remembered that he had left an eminent KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys Counsel$
and Member of Parliament smoking his cigar in a _loge_ of the Tangier$
circus.$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\I missed you,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell the next morning. M-bM-^@M-^\When you remembered and$
came to pick me up, I was on my way backM-bM-^@M-^Twe must have passed somewhere$
in the little Sok. What happened last night?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nothing much,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. M-bM-^@M-^\I went round and saw the girl.$
She was very amusing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How amusing?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the other curiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, just amusing.M-bM-^@M-^] Vaguely: M-bM-^@M-^\I found her annoyed by the attention which$
was being paid to her by a veritable Spanish hidalgo.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And you sailed in and rescued her, eh?M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\And what happened$
to her after she was rescued?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I saw her home to her hotel, and there the matter ended. By the way,$
she leaves by the _Gibel Musa_ for Gibraltar this morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hm!M-bM-^@M-^] Maxell looked absently at the letter he had in his hand, folded it$
and put it away.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is the mail in?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Cartwright, interested, and Maxell nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I suppose youM-bM-^@M-^Yve had your daily letter from your kiddie?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\it is not a baby letter, but it is very amusing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How old is she?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She must be nine or ten,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wonder if it is just coincidence, or whether it is fate,M-bM-^@M-^] mused$
Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is a coincidence?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the other.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The fact that youM-bM-^@M-^Yve got a kid to look after, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym in a sort of way$
responsible for a bright lad. Mine is less interesting than yours, I$
think. Anyway, heM-bM-^@M-^Ys a boy and a sort of cousin. He has two fool parents$
who were born to slaveryM-bM-^@M-^Tthe sort of people who are content to work for$
somebody all their lives and regard revolt against their condition as an$
act of impiety. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve only seen the kid once, and he struck me as the$
sort who might break loose from that kind of life and take a chance.$
Otherwise, I wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt have interested myself in him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How far does your interest extend?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Maxell curiously. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre not$
the sort of person, I should imagine, who would take up the unfortunate$
poor as a hobby.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not a something-for-nothing man, in fact,M-bM-^@M-^] laughed Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
been told that twice in twenty-four hours.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who was the other personM-bM-^@M-^Tthe actress?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright roared with laughter and slapped the other on the knee.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a good guesser,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\No, I am not a something-for-nothing$
person. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym one of those optimists who plant fir cones so that I shall$
have some good firewood for my old age. I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what sort of a man$
Timothy will make, but, as I say, he shapes good, and anyway, you and I$
are in the same boat.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Except this,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, M-bM-^@M-^\that from what you say, you arenM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
particularly interested in your protM-CM-)gM-CM-), and you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt really care$
whether he shapes good or shapes bad.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys true,M-bM-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys an experiment.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My little girl is something more than that,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell quietly;$
M-bM-^@M-^\sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys the only living thing I have any real affection forM-bM-^@M-^Tshe is my$
dead brotherM-bM-^@M-^Ys child.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Your niece, eh? Well, that gives you an interest which I have not. I$
never had a niece and I should just hate to be called uncle, anyway.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Their conversation was interrupted at this point by the arrival of a$
small man dressed in his best clothes. On his brow was a frown which was$
intended to be terrible, but was slightly amusing. Jose Ferreira had$
dressed and prepared himself for an interview which, as he had described$
to his friends, could not fail to be at once M-bM-^@M-^\terrifying and vital.M-bM-^@M-^]$
For, as he had said: M-bM-^@M-^\This man has sliced my life!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He began his speech to Cartwright as he had rehearsed it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Estoy indignadoM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T_M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
But Cartwright cut him short with an expression of mock fear.$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Horroroso!_ You are indignant, are you? Well, come, little man, and$
tell me why you are indignant.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SeM-CM-1or,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man solemnly, M-bM-^@M-^\you have put upon me a humiliation and$
a shame which all my life I shall regret.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The conversation was in Spanish, but Maxell was an excellent Spanish$
scholar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the trouble?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked, before Jose, still labouring under the$
sense of his wrongs, could get going again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Listen to him and discover,M-bM-^@M-^] mocked Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\I have taken from his$
incomparable company its joy and its gem.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In other words, the amiable Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, yes, seM-CM-1or,M-bM-^@M-^] broke in Jose. M-bM-^@M-^\For me it is ruin! The money I have$
spent to make my company perfect! It is financed by one who is the$
greatest man in Tangier and it is his son who tells me that, unless I$
bring back this ladyM-bM-^@M-^Tfor me there is the street and the gutter,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
wept.$
$
Maxell looked slyly at his companion.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys another chance for you to plant a fir cone,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\CanM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
you find some use for this gentleman?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
But Cartwright was not smiling.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SeM-CM-1or Ferreira,M-bM-^@M-^] he said crisply, M-bM-^@M-^\you are, as all Spain knows, a thief$
and a rogue. If you associate with bigger thieves and bigger scoundrels,$
that is your business. I can only tell you that you may think yourself$
lucky I did not bring this case before the Spanish Consul. I assure you,$
you would never have put your foot in Tangier again after the stories I$
have heard about you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The little Spaniard was open-mouthed and impressed. He was also a little$
frightened. CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys accusation had been at a venture, but he argued$
that it was scarcely likely that, in an establishment of the description$
which Mr. Ferreira controlled, there could have been no incidents which$
reflected upon the manager.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Everything which is said about me is a lie!M-bM-^@M-^] said the little man$
vigorously. M-bM-^@M-^\I have lived a life of the highest virtue! To-day I$
complain to the British Consul, and we shall see!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Complain,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This chance I will give you.M-bM-^@M-^] SeM-CM-1or Ferreira wagged a fat, stumpy$
finger. M-bM-^@M-^\Restore to me Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady, and the matter shall go no$
farther.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady has left Tangier,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other calmly, M-bM-^@M-^\so it is clear$
to you that I cannot restore her.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She has not left,M-bM-^@M-^] vociferated the Spaniard. M-bM-^@M-^\We had a man to watch the$
boat leaving for the _Gibel Musa_ and she did not leave the pier.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She left the beach,M-bM-^@M-^] explained Cartwright patiently; M-bM-^@M-^\she was rowed out$
by a boatman from the Cecil. At this moment she is half-way to$
Gibraltar.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Ferreira groaned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is ruin for me,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Perhaps for you also,M-bM-^@M-^] he added$
ominously. M-bM-^@M-^\I can do no less than depart for Paris to lay this matter$
before my excellent patron, SeM-CM-1or DonM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright jerked his head to the door.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Get out,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, and turned his attention to the newspaper which he$
had picked up from the table.$
$
Maxell waited until the little man had gone, still seething with his$
M-bM-^@M-^\indignado,M-bM-^@M-^] then turned to Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This is rather a serious matter, Cartwright; what has happened to the$
girl?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DidnM-bM-^@M-^Yt you hear? I have sent her to Gibraltar,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\I$
wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt leave a dog in that company. And from Gibraltar she goes home$
by the first P. & O.,M-bM-^@M-^] he said briefly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hm!M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell for the second time.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What the devil are you M-bM-^@M-^XhmingM-bM-^@M-^Y about?M-bM-^@M-^] snarled his companion. M-bM-^@M-^\The girl$

disapprove?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sorry,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know you felt so bad about it. No, I$

M-bM-^@M-^\Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright$
sententiously, M-bM-^@M-^\for he shall not be disappointed. I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt suppose that$

That afternoon the two men had an interview on the outskirts of the town$
with a very plainly dressed Moor, who came to them so cautiously that$
the observers might have been pardoned if they thought he was a$
criminal. In the eyes of the divine rulers of Morocco he was something$
more than a criminal, because he was an emissary of El Mograb, the$
Pretender. There was a price upon the messengerM-bM-^@M-^Ys head, and his caution$
was, therefore, commendable. He brought a letter from El Mograb to$
Cartwright, and it was a message of cheer.$
$
Maxell and his friend had gone out early in the afternoon and had waited$
two hours under a scorching sun for the courier to arrive. For a man of$
law, the fact that he was coquetting with the SultanM-bM-^@M-^Ys enemy did not$
distress Maxell, who knew the history of the country too well to worry$
very much about Sultan or Pretender. The SultanM-bM-^@M-^Ys reign, marked with the$
turbulence of people and the self-indulgence of monarch, was already$
doomed. His uncle, El Mograb, a born leader of men and captain of seven$
thousand well-armed soldiers, was but waiting the psychological moment$
to strike; and Adbul, with his motor-cars and brass bedstead, his$
geegaws and his frippery, would disappear into the limbo which is$
especially reserved for extravagant and unstable rulers.$
$
The news from El Mograb was good. It reconfirmed the concession which$
one of his shereefs had made on his behalf, and sent a message in$
flowery ArabicM-bM-^@M-^Ta message of thanks to the man who had supplied him with$
the very necessary rifles.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That was news to me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright as they rode back to the town. M-bM-^@M-^\I$
didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know you were gun-running, Maxell, or that you were so solid with$
El Mograb.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I like El Mograb,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys one of the many Moors who have$
impressed me. You mustnM-bM-^@M-^Yt forget that I have been visiting Morocco since$
I was a boy and most of the chiefs are known to me personally. I knew El$
MograbM-bM-^@M-^Ys brother, who was killed at Tetuan, and when he was a favourite$
in court circles he entertained me at Fez.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is his word worth?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Cartwright carelessly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is worth all the contracts that ever went to Somerset House for$
stamping,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other with emphasis. M-bM-^@M-^\I think you can go ahead with$
your scheme.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go back to London and raise the money,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\We shall want a$
couple of millions eventually, but half a million will do to go on with.$
You had better be with me in the big scheme, Maxell. There is nothing to$
lose for you. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yll be in on the ground floor. What is the good of your$
pottering about with your little CompanyM-bM-^@M-^TI mean the Parent Company?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have faith in that,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\I know just the amount of my$
indebtedness.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a fool,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other shortly. M-bM-^@M-^\The big scheme may mean$
millions to you, and I shall want your help and guidance.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell hesitated. The lure was dazzling, the prize was immense. But it$
meant risks which he was not prepared to take. He knew something of$
CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys financial methods; he had seen them in their working, and$
had done not a little on one occasion to save Cartwright from the$
consequences of his own cleverness. Yet, as he argued, Cartwright would$
have no difficulty in raising the money from the general public, and his$
presence on the board would certainly be a guarantee against his$
companion departing from the narrow path.$
$
Although it was not generally known that he was associated in any of$
CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys enterprises, there had been a whisper of an inquiry in$
influential quarters, and it had been hinted to him that, on the whole,$
it would be better if he kept himself aloof from the gentleman who,$
admirable business man as he was, had a passion for enterprises which$
occasionally verged upon the illegal. But those influential quarters had$
not whispered anything in the shape of a definite promise that his$
welfare was entirely in their keeping and that his future would not be$
overlooked.$
$
He was an ambitious man, but his ambitions ran in realisable directions.$
The services he had rendered to the Government were such as deserved a$
recognition, and the only question was what form that recognition would$
take? His knowledge of languages qualified him for an important$
appointment under the Foreign Office; but the Foreign Office was a close$
preserve and difficult to break into. There were too many permanent$
officials who regarded the service as a family affair, and were jealous$
of patronage outside their own charmed circle.$
$
He went in to lunch that day to find Cartwright reading a telegram which$
he folded up and put into his pocket upon the otherM-bM-^@M-^Ys appearance.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My little friend has arrived in Gibraltar,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
$
Maxell looked at him curiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What happens now?M-bM-^@M-^] he demanded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sending her home.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys voice was brisk and he spoke in the manner of a man$
referring to a topic too unimportant to be discussed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And after?M-bM-^@M-^] pursued Maxell, and the other shrugged his shoulders.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have given her a letter of introduction to a friend of mine,M-bM-^@M-^] he said$
carelessly. M-bM-^@M-^\I have one or two theatrical interests in town.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell said nothing, and could have dismissed the matter as lightly as$
his companion, for the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys future scarcely interested him.$
$
She had been but a figure on the stage; her personality, her very$
appearance, left no definite impression. But if he was not interested in$
the girl, he was interested in CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys private mind. Here was a man$
of whom he could not know too much. And somehow he felt that he had$
hardly cracked the surface of CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys character though he had known$
him for years, and though they were working together to a common end.$
$
The way of a man with a maid is wonderful, but it is also instructive to$
the cold-blooded onlooker, who discovers in that way a kind of creature$
he has never met before; a new man, so entirely different from the$
familiar being he had met in club or drawing-room as to be almost$
unrecognisable. And he wanted to know just this side of Cartwright,$
because it was the side on which he had scarcely any information.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I suppose you wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt see her again?M-bM-^@M-^] he said, playing with his knife and$
looking abstractedly out of the window.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt think so,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, and then, with a sudden$
irritation: M-bM-^@M-^\What the devil are you driving at, Maxell? I may see the$
girlM-bM-^@M-^TI go to music-halls, and it is hardly likely I should miss her.$
Naturally I am interested in the lady I have rescued from this kind of$
thingM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^The waved his hand vaguely toward Tangier BayM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\and she may be$
useful. You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt mean to say _youM-bM-^@M-^Yre_ struck on her?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He tried to carry war into the enemyM-bM-^@M-^Ys camp and failed, for MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
blue eyes met his steadily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I hardly know what she looks like,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and I am not likely to$
fall in love with a lady who left absolutely no impression upon me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
                 *        *        *        *        *$
$
He left next day on the boat for Cadiz, _en route_ to Paris and London,$
and he and Cartwright had as a fellow-passenger a shabby little man$
whose belongings were packed in an American-cloth suit-case inscribed in$
flourishing capitals, evidently by the owner, M-bM-^@M-^\Jose Ferreira.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Ferreira spent most of his time on the shipM-bM-^@M-^Ys deck, biting his nails$
and enlarging his grievance against the unconscious Cartwright.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER III$
$
$
MAXELL did not stay many hours in Paris. The Sud Express landed him in$
the French capital at seven in the morning. He left Paris by the midday$
train for London. The Long Vacation was drawing to an end, and there$
were briefs of certain importance requiring examination. There was also$
a consultation with the Attorney-General on an interpretation of a$
clause in the new Shipping Act, and he was also due to address his$
constituents before the reassembling of Parliament.$
$
He might ruminate in vain to find one attractive feature of his$
programme. Parliament wearied him, and the ordinary practices of the law$
no longer gave him pleasure.$
$
There was an interest in the work he was doing for the Government, and$
if he had the faintest hint of pleasure in his immediate prospects, the$
cause was to be found in the vexed problems centring about this new, and$
loosely drawn, shipping law. It was a measure which had been passed in a$
hurry, and when the acid test of litigation had been applied, some of$
its weak points had been discovered.$
$
The weakest of these points was one affecting the load-line. In an$
action heard before a High Court Judge, the doubtful clause had been$
interpreted so as to render the Act a dead letter; and there were$
particular and especial Governmental reasons why the appeal which the$
Government had made from the verdict of the lower Court should upset$
that decision.$
$
There is no need to give the particulars of the great dispute, which$
arose over the three words M-bM-^@M-^\or otherwise loaded,M-bM-^@M-^] and it is only$
necessary to say that, before he had reached London, Mr. Maxell had$
discovered a way for the Government out of their difficulty.$
$
It was this opinion which he delivered to a relieved Attorney-General,$
and, with the new argument, the Government were able to present so$
strong a case to the Court of Appeal, that a month after his return the$
verdict of the lower Court was reversed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Attorney-General, M-bM-^@M-^\the devils can take it to the House$
of Lords now and still loseM-bM-^@M-^Tthanks to your brain wave, Maxell!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They were smoking in the Crown Room at the Law Courts after the decision$
had been delivered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where have you been for your holiday, by the way?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the Attorney$
suddenly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Morocco,M-bM-^@M-^] replied the other.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Morocco?M-bM-^@M-^] The Attorney nodded thoughtfully. M-bM-^@M-^\Did you hear anything of$
friend Cartwright?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We were staying at the same hotel,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Maxell.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A weird person,M-bM-^@M-^] said the thoughtful Attorney. M-bM-^@M-^\A very curious$
manM-bM-^@M-^Twhat a Chancellor that fellow would make!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He never struck me that way,M-bM-^@M-^] smiled Maxell.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know him wellM-bM-^@M-^TI mean, are you a particular friend of his?M-bM-^@M-^]$
demanded the Attorney.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell indifferently. M-bM-^@M-^\I know himM-bM-^@M-^Tso many men in the law$
know him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre not by any chance associating with him in business now, are$
you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell promptly.$
$
It was a lie and he knew it was a lie. It was told deliberately from the$
desire to stand well in the eyes of his friends. He knew CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
reputation well enough, and just how he was regarded by the party whom$
he had served for three years. Cartwright had been Member for a London$
borough, but had resigned. M-bM-^@M-^\Pressure of businessM-bM-^@M-^] was the excuse he$
gave, but there were people who said that it was owing to the pressure$
of the Party Whips, who smelt a somewhat unsavoury case coming into$
Court with Cartwright figuring prominently.$
$
There is no way of proving or disproving the statement, because the case$
in which Cartwright most decidedly was interested was withdrawn from the$
list at the last moment. The uncharitable say that it cost Cartwright a$
small fortune to bring about this withdrawal, and certainly one of the$
ladies interested (she was a small-part actress at the Hippoceus) gave$
up her stage work and had been living in affluence ever since.$
Cartwright pooh-poohed the suggestion that the case held anything$
sensationalM-bM-^@M-^Tbut he did not enter political life again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I am glad youM-bM-^@M-^Yre not associated with him,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Attorney simply.$
M-bM-^@M-^\HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys an awfully nice fellow and I suppose he is as straight and as$
sound as the best man in the City. But heM-bM-^@M-^Ys a shifty fellowM-bM-^@M-^Tjust a$
little bitM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^The hesitatedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\a little wrong. You understand, MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Tor$
shall we say slightly shop-soiled?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He is certainly a brilliant man,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, not desirous of$
defending his friend too vigorously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, I suppose he is,M-bM-^@M-^] admitted the Attorney. M-bM-^@M-^\All men like that are$
brilliant. What a pity his genius does not run in a smooth channel, but$
must follow the course of a burning cracker, here, there and everywhere,$
exploding at every turn!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He slipped down from the table, on the edge of which he had been sitting$
and pulled off his robe.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym glad to know youM-bM-^@M-^Yre not associated with Cartwright, anyway,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said.$
$
Maxell did not attempt to probe beneath the surface of his$
twice-repeated remark.$
$
He went back to Cavendish Square to his flat and to a tiny, solemn-eyed$
little girl who had been brought up from Hindhead that day on her$
monthly visit to M-bM-^@M-^\Uncle Max.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright had not accompanied his friend to England, and with good$
reasons. A great deal of his work was carried out in Paris, where he had$
an important financial backing. He occupied a flat overlooking the$
imposing, but none too convenient, Avenue of the Grand Army. His home$
was at the unfashionable end of this interminable thoroughfare, which$
meant that his rooms were larger and his rent cheaper, and that he was$
freer from observation than he would have been had he lived according to$
his means or station in a luxurious flat nearer the Etoil.$
$
He had a board meeting to attend, an informal board meeting, it is true,$
but none the less important.$
$
Cartwright was the chairman and managing director of the London and$
Paris Gold Syndicate, a flourishing concern which held big blocks of$
shares in various land and gold-mining companies, and controlled three$
mines of its own on the West Rand. Though a Company drawing a modest$
revenue from its Johannesburg property, its operations were not confined$
to gold development pure and simple. It was, in fact, an outside$
brokerM-bM-^@M-^Ys on a grand scale. It gambled heavily and gambled wisely. The$
shareholders seldom received less than a twelve and a half per cent.$
dividend, and there were years when in addition it paid a bonus equal to$
its own share capital.$
$
It numbered its clients at one hundred and fifty thousand, the majority$
being small people who preferred speculation to investmentM-bM-^@M-^Tcountry$
parsons, doctors and the small gamblers who lived fearfully on the$
fringe of high finance. The shares were at a premium and CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
interest brought him a considerable sum annually. What probably$
attracted the little speculator was the knowledge of the CompanyM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
reserve, which stood in the balance-sheet at a respectable figure. It$
was the question of these reserves that occupied the attention of the$
four quiet men who met informally in the room of a Paris hotel.$
$
There were three to one against Cartwright, because none of his$
companions could see eye to eye with him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is too dangerous, M. Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] said Gribber, whose nationality$
was suspect; M-bM-^@M-^\our risks are already high and we cannot afford, in my$
judgment, to extend them. The money would be subscribed over and over$
again if you went to the English public.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright frowned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt we make the profit?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked; M-bM-^@M-^\we could borrow from our$
reserve.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That we canM-bM-^@M-^Yt touch!M-bM-^@M-^] interrupted the cautious Gribber, shaking his$
head violently. M-bM-^@M-^\My faith, no, we cannot touch that! For it is certain$
that the lean years will come when our clients will require their$
dividends.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright did not pursue the subject. There were other ways of$
financing his Moorish scheme.$
$
The Benson Syndicate, for example.$
$
He spoke eloquently of this new venture, which was to have its$
headquarters in Paris, and would be under the eye of his sceptical$
co-directors. He mentioned names glibly and easilyM-bM-^@M-^Tnames that carried$
weight in the financial world. The three men agreed that the Benson$
Syndicate had the appearance of a safe investment.$
$
                 *        *        *        *        *$
$
More important was the business which brought Alfred Cartwright to the$
St. Lazaire Station to meet a passenger a week later.$
$
She sprang from the train and looked round with doubting face, which$
lighted the moment she saw the saturnine Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My! I am relieved,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\I was scared to think you wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be$
here to meet me, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yd only got a few pounds left.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You got my wire?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked, and she smiled, showing two rows of pearly$
teeth.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym still mystified,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\What is it you want me to do in$
Paris?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Let us eat first and talk afterwards,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\You must be hungry.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym starving!M-bM-^@M-^] she laughed.$
$
He had a car waiting for her, and whisked her off to a little street$
leading from the Boulevard des Italiens, where one of the best$
restaurants in Paris is situated. The girl looked about her with an$
approving air. The gaiety and luxury of the place appealed to her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My word!M-bM-^@M-^] she said enviously; M-bM-^@M-^\do you come to lunch here every day?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know this place?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve seen it,M-bM-^@M-^] she admitted, M-bM-^@M-^\but a three-franc dinner at DuvalM-bM-^@M-^Ys has$
been my limit so far.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She told him how she had come to the Continent as a dancer, and had$
M-bM-^@M-^\starredM-bM-^@M-^] in a tiny little cabaret in Montmartre as one of the M-bM-^@M-^\dashing$
Sisters Jones,M-bM-^@M-^] before she had been seen by the impresario who was$
recruiting material for his tour through the Levant.$
$
Cartwright judged her to be nineteen, knew her to be extremely pretty,$
and guessed that, under certain conditions, she would be presentable$
even to the best of the circles in which he moved. He wondered, with a$
grim smile, what Maxell, that austere and fastidious man, would say if$
he knew that the girl was with him in Paris. Would Maxell accept her? He$
thought not. Maxell was a thought straitlaced and in some ways was a$
bore. But Maxell was necessary. He was a brilliant lawyer, and moreover$
stood well with the Government, and there might come a time when Maxell$
would be immensely useful. He could well afford to give the lawyer a$
slice of the pickings he intended making, because MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys wants were$
few and his ambitions on the modest side.$
$
Cartwright thought in millions. Maxell was a five-figure man. If all$
went well with CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys scheme, undoubtedly he could well afford the$
five figures.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What happened to your friend?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl, as though divining his$
thoughts: M-bM-^@M-^\The man you told me I was to keep away from. Why didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt you$
want him to see me?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright shrugged his shoulders.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Does it really matter?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked; M-bM-^@M-^\heM-bM-^@M-^Ys in England, anyway.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who is he?M-bM-^@M-^] She was curious.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, a friend of mine.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And who are you?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked, facing him squarely. M-bM-^@M-^\If IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to see$
anything of you in Paris, that Smith, Brown or Robinson business isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
quite good enough. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve been decent to me, but I want to know who IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
working for, and what is the kind of work you want me to do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright pinched his neckM-bM-^@M-^Ta nervous little trick of his when he was$
thinking.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have business interests here,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want me for an office?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously. M-bM-^@M-^\My education$
is perfectly rotten.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want you for an office,M-bM-^@M-^] he replied with a smile. M-bM-^@M-^\And yet$
in a sense I want you to do office work. I have a little syndicate here,$
which is known as the Benson Syndicate. Benson is my nameM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Or the name you go by,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quickly, and he laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How sharp you are! Well, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt suppose OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady is your name, if it$
comes to that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She made no reply and he went on:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I want somebody in Paris I can rely upon; somebody who will receive$
money, transmit it to the Benson Syndicate, and re-invest that money in$
such concerns as I shall indicate.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt use long words,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\How do you know IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not going to rob$
you? NobodyM-bM-^@M-^Ys ever trusted me with money before.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He might have told her that she would not be trusted with a great deal$
at a time and that she would be carefully watched. He preferred,$
however, an explanation more flattering to his new assistant. And not$
only was it flattering, but it contained a big grain of truth,$
expressing, to an extent, Alfred CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys creed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Women are more honest than men,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I should think twice before$
I put a manM-bM-^@M-^Teven my best friendM-bM-^@M-^Tin the position IM-bM-^@M-^Ym putting you. It$
will be a simple matter, and I shall pay you well. You can live at one$

You mayM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^The hesitatedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\you may be Madam Benson, a rich Englishwoman.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked at him from under perplexed brows.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is the good of asking me to do that?M-bM-^@M-^] she said in a tone of$
disappointment. M-bM-^@M-^\I thought you were going to give me a job I could do.$
IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a fool at business.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You can remain a fool,M-bM-^@M-^] he said coolly. M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys nothing to do except$
carry out a certain routine, which I shall explain to you so that you$
canM-bM-^@M-^Yt possibly make a mistake. Here is a job which gives you plenty of$
time, pays you well, gives you good clothes and an auto. Now, are you$
going to be a sensible girl and take it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She thought a moment, then nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If it means lunching here every day, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll take it,M-bM-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
$
Thus was formed the remarkable Benson Syndicate, about which so much has$
been written, and so many theories evolved. For, if the truth be told,$
the Benson Syndicate had no existence until Cartwright called it into$
being in CiroM-bM-^@M-^Ys Restaurant. It was born of the opposition he had$
received, and its creation was hastened by certain disquieting telegrams$
which arrived almost every hour from London.$
$
Cartwright was, as has been said, a man of many interests. The$
door-plate of his office in Victoria Street, London, was covered with$
the names of the companies which had their headquarters in the ornate$
suite which he occupied. There were two other suites of offices in the$
City of London for which Mr. Cartwright paid the rent, although he did$
not pay it in his own name. There were syndicates and companies$
innumerable, Development Syndicates, Exploitation Companies, Financial$
and Mining Companies, all duly registered and all keeping one solicitor$
busy; for the Companies Acts are tricky, and Cartwright was too clever a$
man to contravene minor regulations.$
$
And to all these companies there were shareholders; some of them$
contented, someM-bM-^@M-^Tthe majorityM-bM-^@M-^Twholly dissatisfied with their lot, and$
quite a large number who were wont to show their share certificates to$
their friends as curiosities, and tell them the sad story of how they$
were inveigled into investment.$
$
Only a clever company lawyer can describe in detail the tortuous$
character of CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys system of finance. It involved loans from one$
company to another, very often on the security of shares in a third$
company; it involved a system of over-drafts, drawn in favour of some$
weakly member of his family, secured by the assets of one which could$
show a bold face to the world, and was even quoted in the Stock Exchange$
list; and divers other complicated transactions, which only the expert$
mathematician could follow.$
$
Cartwright was a rich man, accounted a millionaire by his friends; but$
he was that type of millionaire who was never at a loss for a thousand,$
but who was generally hard up for ten thousand. He came to London much$
against his will, in response to an urgent telegram, and, having cleared$
the difficulties which his subordinates had found insuperable, he had a$
few hours to attend to his private affairs before he took the train back$
to Paris.$
$
His secretary produced a heap of small bills requiring settlement, and$
going through these, he paused before one printed slip, and frowned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That boyM-bM-^@M-^Ys school fees werenM-bM-^@M-^Yt paid last term,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] said the secretary. M-bM-^@M-^\If you remember, I mentioned the matter$
to you when you were in London last. I was taking upon myself the$
responsibility of paying the fees, if you hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt returned. The boy is$
coming up to-day, by the way, sir, to be measured for some clothes.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Coming here?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Mr. Cartwright, interested.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, sir.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright picked up the bill.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] he read. M-bM-^@M-^\What does T. A. C. stand forM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XTake A$
ChanceM-bM-^@M-^Y?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I understood he was named after youM-bM-^@M-^TTimothy Alfred Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
the secretary.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes; of course,M-bM-^@M-^] Cartwright grinned. M-bM-^@M-^\Still, Take A Chance isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a bad$
name for a kid. When is he arriving?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He ought to be here now,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man, looking at his watch. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go$
out and see.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He disappeared into the outer office, and presently returned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The boy is here, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Would you like to see him?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Bring him in,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd like to meet this nephew, or$
cousin, or whatever he is.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He wondered vaguely what had induced him to take upon himself the$
responsibility of the small child, and with remorseless judgment$
analysed the reason as being personal vanity.$
$
The door opened and a child strode in. M-bM-^@M-^\StrodeM-bM-^@M-^] is the only word to$
describe the quick, decisive movement of the bright-eyed lad who looked$
with unflinching eye at Cartwright. Cartwright did not look at his$
clothes, but at the grey, clear eyes, the firm mouth, extraordinarily$
firm for a boy of fourteen, and the capable and not over-clean hands.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sit down, son,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\So youM-bM-^@M-^Yre my nephew.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Cousin, I think,M-bM-^@M-^] said the boy, critically examining the contents of$
CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys table. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre Cousin Alfred, arenM-bM-^@M-^Yt you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a cousin, am I? Yes, I suppose I am,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amused.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I say,M-bM-^@M-^] said the boy, M-bM-^@M-^\is that the school bill? The Head has been$
rather baity about that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M-bM-^@M-^XBaityM-bM-^@M-^Y?M-bM-^@M-^] said the puzzled Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys a new one on me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shirty,M-bM-^@M-^] said the boy calmly. M-bM-^@M-^\Annoyed, I suppose, is the correct$
word.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright chuckled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you want to be?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A financier,M-bM-^@M-^] said T. A. C. Anderson promptly.$
$
He seated himself, leant his elbow on the desk and his head on his hand,$
his eyes never leaving Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys a great schemeM-bM-^@M-^Tfinance,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a whale at$
mathematics.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What particular branch of finance?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Cartwright with a smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Other peopleM-bM-^@M-^Ys finance,M-bM-^@M-^] said the boy promptly; M-bM-^@M-^\the same business as$
yours.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright threw back his head and laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And do you think youM-bM-^@M-^Yd be able to keep twenty companies in the air at$
the same time?M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In the air?M-bM-^@M-^] the boy frowned. M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, you mean going all at once? Rather!$
Anyway, IM-bM-^@M-^Yd take a chance.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The phrase struck Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take a chance? ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys curious. I called you Take A Chance Anderson just$
before you came in.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, they all call me that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the boy indifferently. M-bM-^@M-^\You see,$
theyM-bM-^@M-^Yre bound to stick a label on to a fellow with an initial like mine.$
Some of them call me M-bM-^@M-^XTin and Copper Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^Y but most of themM-bM-^@M-^Tthe$
other name.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a rum kid,M-bM-^@M-^] said his cousin. M-bM-^@M-^\You can come to lunch with me.M-bM-^@M-^]$

                               CHAPTER IV$
$
$
MR. ALFRED CARTWRIGHT had the enviable faculty of placing outside of$
his mind all subjects and persons which were unpleasant to think upon.$
Possessing this power, he could as lightly dismiss the memory of$
responsibilities, pleasant or unpleasant. He had scarcely left London$
before he had waived Master T. A. C. Anderson into oblivion. To do him$
justice, he had certainly speculated vaguely upon assuring his cousinM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
future; but his mind was so completely occupied with his own that there$
was really not room for bothM-bM-^@M-^Tand Take A Chance Anderson had to go.$
$
He reached Paris by the evening train, and drove straight to the$
apartment he had taken for his new protM-CM-)gM-CM-). He found her installed in a$
very comfortable flat on the unfashionable side of the Seine, and was$
welcomed with relief.$
$
Miss Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady had not entirely overcome her suspicions of the _bona$
fides_ of her newfound acquaintance. Yet, since he had not made love to$
her, but, on the contrary, had made it very clear that the part he$
expected her to play in his schemes involved no loss of self-respect,$
she was becoming reconciled to a relationship which, to say the least,$
was a strange one. She had established herself in a third-floor office$
on one of the boulevards, an uncomfortable and unaccustomed figure in an$
environment which was wholly foreign to her experience, though there was$
no need for her embarrassment, since she constituted the whole of the$
staff, and the callers were confined to the postman and the concierge$
who acted as office-cleaner.$
$
She was to learn, however, that a daily attendance at her M-bM-^@M-^\bureauM-bM-^@M-^] did$
not constitute the whole of her duties, or fulfil all CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
requirements.$
$
It was not until after dinner that night that Cartwright revealed$
himself.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sadie, my young friend,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, between puffs of his cigar, M-bM-^@M-^\I am$
going to tell you just what I want you to do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I thought I knew,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, on her guard, and he laughed softly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yll never quite know what I want you to do,M-bM-^@M-^] he said frankly, M-bM-^@M-^\until$
I tell you. Now, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym putting it to you very straight. I want nothing$
from you except service. And the service I require is of a kind which$
you need not hesitate to give me. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre an actress, and I can speak to$
you more plainly than I could to some unsophisticated girl.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She wondered what was coming, but had not long to wait.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will tell you something,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\which is really more important$
than my name, about which you showed so much curiosity. There is a man$
in this city whom I want to get at.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How do you mean?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He is a man who has it in his power to ruin meM-bM-^@M-^Ta drunken sot of a$
fellow, without brain or imagination.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He went on to explain briefly that he himself was a company promoter,$
and that he had an interest in a mine, as yet unproved, in Morocco.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is why you were there?M-bM-^@M-^] she nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is exactly why,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\Unfortunately, right in the$
midst of the ground which I have either bought or secured mineral rights$
over, is a block of land which is the property of this man. He is a$
SpaniardM-bM-^@M-^Tdo you speak Spanish?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A little,M-bM-^@M-^] she admitted, M-bM-^@M-^\but it is precious little!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt matter,M-bM-^@M-^] Cartwright shook his head. M-bM-^@M-^\He speaks English very$
well. Now, this land is absolutely valueless to the man, but every$
attempt I have made to buy it has been unsuccessful, and it is vitally$
necessary at this moment, when I am floating a company to develop the$
property, that his claims should be included in my properties.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is his name?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Brigot,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Brigot?M-bM-^@M-^] repeated Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady thoughtfully. M-bM-^@M-^\I seem to have heard$
that name before.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is pretty common in France, but not so common in Spain,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr.$
Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And what am I to do?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will get you an introduction to him,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright; M-bM-^@M-^\heM-bM-^@M-^Ys a man$
with a fine eye for beauty, and in the hands of a clever girl could be$
wound round her little finger.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I see what you mean,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\but nothing doing!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wait!M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\I have told you that it is necessary for me to$
acquire this property. I am taking you into my confidence, and I know$
that you will respect that confidence. I am willing to pay any$
reasonable sum, and I neither want you to steal it nor make any personal$
sacrifice to serve my ends. I am willing to pay, and pay heavily.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you call heavily?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl coolly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\For the property twenty thousandM-bM-^@M-^Tfor you ten thousand pounds,M-bM-^@M-^]$
suggested Cartwright, and the girl nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys got me,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Tell me what your plan is.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My plan is this,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\You will appear to SeM-CM-1or BrigotM-bM-^@M-^TI$
will arrange thatM-bM-^@M-^Tas a wealthy young American lady who has been$
spending the winter in Morocco. His property follows a little wooded$
hill, one of the prettiest formations of its kind in the Angera country.$
You must rave about that hill, never cease speaking of its beauty and$
its attractiveness; and you must tell him that you would give anything$
in the world if you could build a house amidst that beautiful$
sceneryM-bM-^@M-^Tdo you understand me?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl nodded again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Brigot is a man somewhat susceptible to feminine charms,M-bM-^@M-^] Cartwright$
went on, M-bM-^@M-^\and, unless I am greatly mistaken, he will in one of his$
obliging moods, offer you the land at a nominal figure, particularly as$
he has been bitterly disappointed in his attempt to find gold.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl after consideration. M-bM-^@M-^\You promised me$
that if I came to Paris you would get me a job in one of the theatres.$
That is what I am after, and the only thing I am fit for. The other$
business doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt seem decentM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds!M-bM-^@M-^] murmured Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is a lot,M-bM-^@M-^] agreed the girl, M-bM-^@M-^\but how am I coming out of this$
business? I come out hopelessly compromised.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright shrugged his shoulders with a deprecating smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My dear girlM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] he began.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wait a moment,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quietly; M-bM-^@M-^\letM-bM-^@M-^Ys have a clear understanding.$
You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt expect me to walk up to SeM-CM-1or Brigot the first time I meet$
him, or even the second, and say: M-bM-^@M-^XYouM-bM-^@M-^Yve a very nice property. What$
will you sell it for?M-bM-^@M-^Y That is not the kind of transaction you expect me$
to conduct, is it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not exactly,M-bM-^@M-^] admitted Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It means just a little more than you say,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl; M-bM-^@M-^\it means$
dinners and suppers and hand-holdings and stringing him along. And after$
it is all over, where am I? IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got as much respect for my character as$
you have for yours, Mr. Mysterious. I want to come out well in this$
business as you do, and I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want to leave my name behind, or be$
known in ParisM-bM-^@M-^Twhich is the worldM-bM-^@M-^Tas a decoy duck. IM-bM-^@M-^Yd do an awful lot$
to please you, because I like you and because youM-bM-^@M-^Yve been decent to me.$
But M-bM-^@M-^Xan awful lotM-bM-^@M-^Y does not mean making me so cheap that I am left in$
the slightly-soiled basket. Do you understand what I mean?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Perfectly,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, amazed at the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys cool reasoning. He$
had not given her credit for any of these fine sentiments she now$
enunciated, and he was piqued, and at the same time a little pleased.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\When you said youM-bM-^@M-^Yd give me ten thousand pounds,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl, M-bM-^@M-^\that$
sounded good. But it is not good enough. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve an idea in the back of my$
mind that the matter is a much bigger one for you than youM-bM-^@M-^Yve told me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How big do you imagine?M-bM-^@M-^] bantered Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think it is big enough to ruin you,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl calmly, M-bM-^@M-^\and that$
youM-bM-^@M-^Yd be willing to pay any price to get this property. Otherwise, youM-bM-^@M-^Yd$
go to the man or send your lawyer in the ordinary way. Now, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want$
your ten thousand pounds, but IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to make a proposition to you.$
IM-bM-^@M-^Yve said I like you and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys no more than the truth. You told me you$
were a bachelor and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve told you that IM-bM-^@M-^Ym man-free and heart-free. I$
donM-bM-^@M-^Yt say I love you, and I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt flatter myself that you love me. But$
if you want this thing to go through, and if you want me to go down in$
the mud to get it, youM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to pay the priceM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And the price isM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Cartwright curiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to marry me,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^YmM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] Cartwright could only gasp his admiration; and then he$
began to laugh, at first quietly, and then, as the humour of the$
situation gained upon him, so loudly that the other patrons of the CafM-CM-)$
Scribe turned to look at him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is a rum idea,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\butM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But?M-bM-^@M-^] she repeated, keeping her eyes on his.$
$
He nodded to her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys a bargain!M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
She looked at him as she put out her hand and took his, and slowly shook$
her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My!M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\You want that fellowM-bM-^@M-^Ys land pretty badly, _I_ know!M-bM-^@M-^]$
and Cartwright began to laugh again.$
$
                 *        *        *        *        *$
$
SeM-CM-1or Brigot lived in some style for a man who was on the verge of ruin.$
He had a small house at Maisons Lafitte and a flat on the Boulevard$
Webber. He was a heavy, tired-looking man, with a dark moustache,$
obviously dyed, and a short beard, bearing evidence of the same$
attention. M. Brigot, like Mr. Cartwright, had many interests; but his$
chief interests were his own tastes and predilections. It was SeM-CM-1or$
BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys boast that, although he had lived for twenty years in Paris, he$
had never seen Paris between the hours of six in the morning and one in$
the afternoon. His breakfast hour was two oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock. By six oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock in the$
evening he was becoming interested in life; and at the hour when most$
people retire to rest, he was in the prime of his day.$
$
It happened on a certain evening that M. Brigot, who usually met dinner$
in an amicable frame of mind, sat down at his favourite table at the$
Abbaye with a big frown, and answered the polite _maM-CM-.tre dM-bM-^@M-^YhM-CM-4telM-bM-^@M-^Ys_$
cheery M-bM-^@M-^\Good eveningM-bM-^@M-^] with a snarl.$
$
Amongst his many enterprises and few possessions, and this Mr.$
Cartwright did not know, was the proprietorship and management of a$
small, ramshackle wooden theatre in the town of Tangier. He was likewise$
interested in several cabarets throughout Spain. But what pained him$
most at the moment was not distressing reports from any of these, but a$
six-page letter received that afternoon from his son, in which the hope$
of the house of Brigot had explained his reasons for discharging$
immediately a very necessary servant. Therefore SeM-CM-1or Brigot swore under$
his breath and cursed his first-born.$
$
Coincident with the arrival of the letter had come one Jose Ferreira,$
who had been detained for a week at Madrid. SeM-CM-1or BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys mind was$
occupied with Jose Ferreira when that worthy, smirking apologetically,$
as though conscious of the shabbiness of his dress-clothes, sidled into$
a seat on the opposite side of the table. SeM-CM-1or Brigot glared at him a$
moment, and Jose Ferreira shifted uneasily in his chair.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If you had telegraphed to me, I would have settled the matter,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Brigot, as though carrying on a conversation which he had broken off a$
few minutes before. M-bM-^@M-^\Instead, like the fool you are, you come all the$
way to Paris, wasting your time in Madrid, and the first I hear of the$
matter is from my son.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was deplorable,M-bM-^@M-^] murmured Jose, M-bM-^@M-^\but Don BrigotM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Don Brigot!M-bM-^@M-^] sneered the father of that worthy. M-bM-^@M-^\Don Brigot is a$
monkey! Why did you take notice of him? Have you nothing else to do in$
Tangier but to look after that flea-ridden theatre? Have you no other$
duties?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The young seM-CM-1or was emphatic,M-bM-^@M-^] murmured the apologetic Jose. M-bM-^@M-^\He$
demanded that I should leave and what could I do?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Brigot grunted something uncomplimentary. Whether it was intended for$
his son or for Ferreira, it was difficult to say. Ferreira was content$
to take it to himself.$
$
Half-way through the dinner Brigot became more human.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There will always be quarrels about women, my good Jose, and it is your$
business to be diplomatic,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\My son is a fool; but then, all$
young men are fools. Why should you neglect my interests because Emanuel$
is a bigger fool than ever? Only this week I intended travelling to$
Tangier with the representative of a very rich syndicate who wishes to$
buy my land.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The same seM-CM-1or as before?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the interested Jose, who was not only$
the manager of TangierM-bM-^@M-^Ys theatre, but was also the representative of the$
rusty little gold-mining company which Brigot had floated.$
$
The other nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The same cursed Englishman,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
Quite unconscious of the fact that his master was cursing the very man$
whom Jose had most recently cursed, the little man smiled$
sympathetically.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I also have a hatred of the English,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\With what insolence do$
they treat one!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
For some time M. Brigot sat in silence, but presently he wiped his mouth$
on his napkin, tossed down a tumbler of red wine, and crooked his finger$
at his companion, inviting closer attention.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In a day, or perhaps two, I shall send you back to Tangier,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The theatre?M-bM-^@M-^] began Jose.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The theatreM-bM-^@M-^Tbah!M-bM-^@M-^] exclaimed the other scornfully. M-bM-^@M-^\A donkey-driver$
could look after the theatre! It is the mine!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The mine?M-bM-^@M-^] repeated the other in some astonishment.$
$
So long had it been since a spade had been put to the ground, so long$
had those hopes of BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys been apparently dead, that the very word$
M-bM-^@M-^\mineM-bM-^@M-^] had ceased to be employed when referring to the property.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My Englishman will buy it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Brigot confidently. M-bM-^@M-^\I happen to know$
that he has taken up property in the neighbourhood, and he has already$
made me an offer. But such an offer! He shall pay my price, Jose,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said, nodding as he picked his teeth, M-bM-^@M-^\and it will be a big price,$
because it is desirable that I should have money.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Jose did not ask the price, but his employer saved him the trouble.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Five million pesetas,M-bM-^@M-^] he said confidently; M-bM-^@M-^\for such a price the$
property will be sold, always providing, my friend, that we do not$
discover gold before the sale.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Jose smiled weakly, a circumstance which seemed to annoy his companion.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are a fool,M-bM-^@M-^] said Brigot irritably; M-bM-^@M-^\you have no brains! You think$
that is a preposterous sum? Wait!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
When his subordinateM-bM-^@M-^Ys dinner was finished, Jose was dismissed$
peremptorily. Brigot had a round of calls to make, a succession of$
people to be visited; and whilst he might interview the little man at$
dinner without losing caste, he had no desire to take him round to his$
usual haunts.$
$
It was at the Abbaye at that golden hour when the price of wine soars$
and all that is smartest in Paris is assembled in the big saloon, that$
M. Brigot, who had reached a stage of geniality, met an entrancing$
vision. Brigot saw the girl and her cavalier at one of the tables, and$
recognised in the latter a well-known man about town. The latter caught$
his eye and walked across to him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who is your charming companion?M-bM-^@M-^] whispered Brigot, whose failing was,$
as Cartwright accurately surmised, a weakness for pretty faces.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She is an American lady who has just come from Morocco,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other$
glibly.$
$
Cartwright had chosen Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGradyM-bM-^@M-^Ys companion very well. In a few$
minutes Brigot had crossed to the other table and taken a seat, was$
introduced, and was in that pleasant glow of mind which comes to the man$
of his class who is conscious of having made an impression.$
$
This M-bM-^@M-^\American widow,M-bM-^@M-^] with her queer, broken French, her beautiful$
eyes, and the charming distinction which goes best with good clothes,$
was more lovely than any woman he had ever metM-bM-^@M-^Tso he swore to himself,$
as he had sworn before. The friendship progressed from day to day, and$
so great was the impression which the girl had made, that Brigot was$
seen abroad at most unusual hours.$
$
The patient Jose Ferreira was despatched on a mission to Madrid, partly$
because Brigot was tired of seeing him hanging about, and partly because$
there was some genuine business to be done in the capital.$
$
Sadie reported progress to her employer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, yes, heM-bM-^@M-^Ys crazy enough about me,M-bM-^@M-^] she said complacently, M-bM-^@M-^\and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
going a little crazy myself. How long is this to go on?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Another week?M-bM-^@M-^] suggested Cartwright, smiling approvingly at the gloom$
on the pretty face. M-bM-^@M-^\Have you mentioned the fact that youM-bM-^@M-^Yve taken a$
fancy to his land?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He wanted to give it to me there and then,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\but you know$
what these Spaniards are. If I had accepted, there would have been$
nothing for me but the front door.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Quite right,M-bM-^@M-^] agreed Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\He is the kind of fish you must play.$
Did he say anything about other offers he had received for the$
property?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He spoke about you,M-bM-^@M-^] she said; M-bM-^@M-^\he called you BensonM-bM-^@M-^Tis that your real$
name?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is good enough,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is queer,M-bM-^@M-^] mused the girl, looking at him thoughtfully, M-bM-^@M-^\that I$
never meet any of your friends in Paris, and that nobody knows youM-bM-^@M-^Tby$
name. I went down to your flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army,M-bM-^@M-^] she$
confessed frankly, M-bM-^@M-^\and asked the concierge. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre Benson there too.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright chuckled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In my business,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\it is necessary that one should be discreet.$
The name which goes in London is not good enough for Paris. And _vice$
versa_,M-bM-^@M-^] he added.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a strange man. I suppose if you marry me in the name of Benson$
it will be legal?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked dubiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course it will be legal. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym surprised at a girl of your$
intelligence asking such a question,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\What is the$
programme for to-night?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She pulled a little face.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The Marigny and supper at CorbetsM-bM-^@M-^Tsupper in a private dining-room.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So itM-bM-^@M-^Ys come to that, has it? Well, you ought to make good to-night,$
Sadie. Remember, I am willing to pay up to fifty thousand pounds. It is$
going to be a tough job raising that money, and it will break my heart$
to pay it. But it will not only break my heart, but it will break me$
everlastingly and confoundedly to pay the manM-bM-^@M-^Ys own priceM-bM-^@M-^Tand his$
property must be bought.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll do my best,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl, M-bM-^@M-^\but you have no doubt in your mind$
that it is going to be hard.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He nodded.$
$
At one oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock the next morning he sat reading in his room, when a knock$
came to his door and the girl came in. She was half hysterical, but the$
light of triumph was in her eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Got it,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Got it!M-bM-^@M-^] he repeated in wonder. M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt mean he sold?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\For ten thousand poundsM-bM-^@M-^Tthree hundred thousand francs. What do you$
think of your little Sadie?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are you serious?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
She nodded, smiling.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What did heM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T?M-bM-^@M-^] he began.$
$
She hesitated and closed her eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk about it,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quickly. M-bM-^@M-^\I have to see him to-morrow at$
his lawyers, and the property will be transferred to me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And after?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She smiled grimly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The after-part will not be as pleasant as M. Brigot imagines,M-bM-^@M-^] she$
said. M-bM-^@M-^\I tell you, that fellowM-bM-^@M-^Ys crazyM-bM-^@M-^Tstark, staring mad. But I felt$
an awful beast, and I think heM-bM-^@M-^Yll kill me when he discovers IM-bM-^@M-^Yve sold$
him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt let that worry you,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright easily.$

$
                               CHAPTER V$
$
$
HE saw the girl down to her waiting auto, and went back to his rooms$
to think. It was curious that at that hour, when the big trouble on his$
mind seemed likely to roll away, that his thoughts flew instantly to$
Maxell. What would the prim Maxell say, if he knew? He was satisfied$
that Maxell would not only disapprove, but would instantly and without$
notice sever all connection with the adventurous company promoter.$
Maxell would be outraged, appalled. Cartwright smiled at the thought.$
$
He was under no illusion as to his own conduct. He knew he was acting$
despicably; but this view he dismissed from his mind as being too$
unpleasant for contemplation. Maxell was a prigM-bM-^@M-^Ta necessary prig, but$
none the less priggish. He was necessary, at any rate, to Cartwright.$
Anyway, Maxell stood to win if the scheme went through.$
$
Cartwright had reached nearly the end of his financial tether, and his$
whole future was bound up in the success or failure of the new$
promotion. He had exhausted every bit of his credit in order to take up$
the Angera property which he knew was rich in gold, and offered$
possibilities which no project of his had offered before.$
$
He had milked his other companies dry, he had played with reserves; all$
except his Anglo-Parisian Finance Company, where the directors were too$
strong to allow him his own way; and, although Maxell was not aware of$
the fact, his M-bM-^@M-^\partnerM-bM-^@M-^] had spent fabulous sums, not only in acquiring$
the land itself but in purchasing other gold-mining property in the$
region. It was a gamble, and a dangerous gamble. He was risking the$
substance of his fortune for the shadow of unlimited wealth.$
$
Yet, was it a risk? he asked himself; with the properties that he could$
include in his new North Morocco Gold Mining AssociationM-bM-^@M-^Tthat was to be$
the title of the new companyM-bM-^@M-^Tthere could be no doubt as to the result$
of the public issue. The British public dearly love a gamble, and a$
gold-mining gamble, with all its mysteries and uncertainties, more$
dearly than any.$
$
He went to bed late, but was taking his chocolate and roll before a$
little cafM-CM-) on the boulevard before nine. At half-past nine he was$
joined by the girl.$
$
Cartwright had been undecided as to whether he should take his _petit$
dM-CM-)jeuner_ outside or inside the cafM-CM-), and had decided, since the morning$
was bright and warm, to breakfast under the striped awning in full view$
of the street. Such great events hang upon slight issues.$
$
Scarcely had the girl seated herself opposite to him, when a pedestrian,$
passing on the other side of the boulevard, halted and stared. Mr.$
Ferreira had sharp eyes and a wit not altogether dulled by his$
monotonous occupation.$
$
Cartwright produced a bulky package from his pocket and laid it on the$
table before the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Put that in your bag and be careful with it,M-bM-^@M-^] he said; M-bM-^@M-^\there are three$
hundred thousand francs in notes. When the property is transferred to$
you, you must bring the transfer along to me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What about your promise?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That I will keep,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt forget that you have the best$
guarantee in the possession of the transfer. Legally, it is your$
property until it is made over to me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She sat looking at the package absently, and presently she said:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to get me out of Paris at once. Otherwise I am due to leave$
by the Sud ExpressM-bM-^@M-^Twith Brigot.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There is a train for Havre at two-fifteen,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
He saw her into her carM-bM-^@M-^Tanother indiscretion since it brought him out$
of the shadow which the awning afforded, and gave the observer on the$
other side of the road an unmistakable view.$
$
Brigot was waiting for herM-bM-^@M-^Ta heavy-eyed, weary-looking man, whose hand$
shook whenever it rose to stroke his short, pointed beard.$
$
His lawyer watched him curiously as he stepped forward to meet the girl$
with hands outstretched. It was not the first time that he had seen his$
client overwhelmed by a pretty face.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Everything is ready, Nanette,M-bM-^@M-^] said the eager M. Brigot. (M-bM-^@M-^\NanetteM-bM-^@M-^] was$
the newfound name which Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady employed for this adventure.) M-bM-^@M-^\See$
here, I have all the documents ready!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And I have the money,M-bM-^@M-^] smiled the girl as she put the package down on$
the table.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The money!M-bM-^@M-^] SeM-CM-1or Brigot waved such sordid matters out of existence$
with a magnificent flourish. M-bM-^@M-^\What is money?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Count it,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will do no such thing,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other extravagantly. M-bM-^@M-^\As a$
caballero, it hurts me to discuss money in connectionM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
But his lawyer had no sentiment, and had slipped the string from the$
package and was now busily counting the thousand-franc notes. When he$
had finished, he put them on the desk.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Can I see you one moment, M. Brigot?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
Brigot, holding the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys hand and devouring her with his eyes, turned$
impatiently.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, no,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\The document, my friend, the document! Give me a$
pen!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There is one point in the deed I must discuss,M-bM-^@M-^] said the lawyer firmly,$
M-bM-^@M-^\if mademoiselle will excuse us for a momentM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] He opened the door of$
his inner office invitingly and with a shrug M. Brigot followed him in.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have told you, monsieur,M-bM-^@M-^] said the lawyer, M-bM-^@M-^\that I do not think your$
action is wise. You are surrendering a property for a sum less than a$
quarter of what you paid for it to a perfectly unknown womanM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\M. lM-bM-^@M-^YAvocat,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other gravely, M-bM-^@M-^\you are speaking of a lady who$
to me is more precious than life!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The lawyer concealed a smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have often spoken to you about ladies who have been more precious to$
you than life,M-bM-^@M-^] he said dryly, M-bM-^@M-^\but in their cases, no transfer of$
valuable property was involved. What do you know of this lady?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know nothing except that she is adorable,M-bM-^@M-^] said the reckless$
Spaniard. M-bM-^@M-^\But for the fact that, alas! my wife most obstinately refuses$
to die or divorce me, I should be honoured to make madame my wife. As it$
is, what a pleasure to give her the land on which to build a beautiful$
villa overlooking my gorgeous TangierM-bM-^@M-^TI am moving to Tangier very soon$
to look after my other propertyM-bM-^@M-^Tand to know that her blessed$
presenceM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The lawyer spread out despairing hands.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then there is nothing to be done,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I only tell you that you$
are transferring a valuable property to a lady who is comparatively$
unknown to you, and it seems to me a very indiscreet and reckless thing$
to do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They returned again to the outer apartment, where the girl had been$
standing nervously twisting the moirM-CM-) bag in her hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here is the document, madame,M-bM-^@M-^] said the lawyer to her relief. M-bM-^@M-^\SeM-CM-1or$
Brigot will sign hereM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^The indicated a lineM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\and you will sign there. I$
will cause these signatures to be witnessed, and a copy of the document$
will be forwarded for registration.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl sat down at the table, and her hand shook as she took up the$
pen. It was at that moment that Jose Ferreira dashed into the room.$
$
He stood open-mouthed at sight of the girl at the table. He tried to$
speak, but the sound died in his throat. Then he strode forward, under$
the glaring eye of his employer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This womanM-bM-^@M-^Tthis woman!M-bM-^@M-^] he gasped.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ferreira,M-bM-^@M-^] cried Brigot in a terrible voice, M-bM-^@M-^\you are speaking of a$
lady who is my friend!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SheM-bM-^@M-^TsheM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tthe man pointed to her with shaking fingerM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\she is the$
woman! She escaped! . . . The woman I told you of, who ran away with an$
Englishman from Tangier!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Brigot stared from one to the other.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre mad,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She is the woman,M-bM-^@M-^] squeaked Ferreira, M-bM-^@M-^\and the man also is in Paris. I$
saw them together this morning at the CafM-CM-) Furnos! The man who was in$
Tangier, of whom I told the seM-CM-1or, and this woman, Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Brigot looked at the girl. She had been caught off her guard, and never$
once had the keen eyes of the lawyer left her. Given some warning, she$
might have dissembled and carried the matter through with a high hand.$
But the suddenness of the accusation, the amazingly unexpected vision of$
Jose, had thrown her off her guard, and Brigot did not need to look$
twice at her to know that the charges of his subordinate were justified.$
She was not a born conspirator, nor was she used to intrigues of this$
character.$
$
Brigot gripped her by the arm and pulled her from the chair. He was half$
mad with rage and humiliation.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is the name of this man?M-bM-^@M-^] he hissed. M-bM-^@M-^\The name of the man who took$
you from Tangier and brought you here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was white as death and terribly afraid.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Benson,M-bM-^@M-^] she stammered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Benson!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The lawyer and Brigot uttered the words together, and the Spaniard,$
releasing his hold stepped back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So it was Benson!M-bM-^@M-^] he said softly. M-bM-^@M-^\Our wonderful Englishman who wanted$
to swindle me out of my property, eh? And I suppose he sent you, my$
beautiful American widow, to purchase land for your villa! Now, you can$
go back to Mr. Benson and tell him that, if my property is good enough$
for him to buy, it is good enough for me to keep. YouM-bM-^@M-^Tyou!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He made a dart at her with upraised hand, but the lawyer was before him$
and gently pushed him back.$
$
He jerked his head to the girl and, shaking like a leaf, she stepped to$
the door and went stumbling down the stairs, which she had mounted with$
such confidence a few minutes before.$
$
Cartwright received the news with extraordinary equanimity.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It has saved us the bother of going out of Paris,M-bM-^@M-^] he said$
thoughtfully. M-bM-^@M-^\And it was my own fault. I never connected that infernal$
fellow Ferreira with BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys enterprises. And anyway, we should not$
have met in public. He said he saw us at the cafM-CM-), did he?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I did my best,M-bM-^@M-^] she faltered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course you did your best,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, patting her hand. M-bM-^@M-^\It is$
tough luck, but it canM-bM-^@M-^Yt be helped.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There was a long silence, then:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What about me?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\Where do I come in? I suppose you have$
no further use for my services?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course I have,M-bM-^@M-^] he said genially. Then, after a longer pause, M-bM-^@M-^\Do$
you know that youM-bM-^@M-^Yre the only person in this world that I have ever$
taken so completely into my confidence and shown what, for a better$
expression, I will call the seamy side of my business? IM-bM-^@M-^Yd like to tell$
you a lot more, because it would be a relief to me to get it off my$
chest. But IM-bM-^@M-^Ym telling you this, that if I marry you to-day, youM-bM-^@M-^Yll have$
to play your part to save me from everlasting ruin.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ruin?M-bM-^@M-^] she said, startled, and he laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not the kind of ruin that means youM-bM-^@M-^Yll go short of food,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but$
the sort of ruin that may meanM-bM-^@M-^Twell, ruin from my point of view. Now$
you must understand this thing clearly, Sadie. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym out for a big stake,$
and if I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt pull it off, itM-bM-^@M-^Ys as likely as not that IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go out.$
YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a clever, useful sort of kid, and I have an idea that you may be$
even more useful. But thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys to be no sentiment in this marriage, mind!$
You have just to sit here and hold tight and do as youM-bM-^@M-^Yre told, and you$
havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt got to pry into my business any further than I want you to. And$
if I go away and donM-bM-^@M-^Yt come back, you must reckon me as dead. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve a lot$
of business in America and elsewhere, which often takes me away for$
months at a time, and youM-bM-^@M-^Yre not to get uneasy. But if you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt hear$
from meM-bM-^@M-^Twhy, you can go down to the Lafayette and buy yourself the$
grandest little suit of mourning that you can afford!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shall I be able to afford it?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I shall put some Rentes to your credit at the Lyonnais. That will give$
you a steady income in case anything happens.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl was troubled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt quite like this idea,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\What will happen?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Cartwright flicked away the ash from the end of his cigar and said$
cheerfully:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That depends entirely upon the view which is taken of a certain$
prospectus issued in London this morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$

                               CHAPTER VI$
$
$
THE New Angera Syndicate was registered as a private company, and its$
prospectus was not made public. Officially, the shares were not offered$
to general subscription, and actually they had been subscribedM-bM-^@M-^Tor the$
first issue of five hundred thousand hadM-bM-^@M-^Tby a little group of shrewd$
speculators in the City of London, who, before now, had made vast sums$
from CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys promotions. The five hundred thousand shares brought$
in about half that number of pounds, and nobody doubted that the$
properties consolidated for the purposes of flotation included the block$
of claims described in the prospectus as M-bM-^@M-^\lately the property of SeM-CM-1or$
Brigot.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Gold had been found on the Angera reef, and gold in sufficient quantity$
to make the new company a very promising speculation. That BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
property could be made to pay, had it been properly managed, was common$
knowledge in the City of London. A dozen offers had been made for this$
concession, but none had been quite acceptable to SeM-CM-1or Brigot, whose$
estimate of the value of the mine varied with the passing hour.$
$
Probably, had it been possible to secure an interview with M. Brigot at$
one oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock in the afternoon, when he arose with a splitting head and a$
dry throat, his possessions might have been acquired at the price of a$
quart of sweet champagne.$
$
But, as the day progressed and his views of life became more charitable,$
his estimate expanded until, by seven oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock in the evening, which hour$
he as a rule reserved for any business discussion, his figure was$
awe-inspiring. Nobody in the City doubted for one moment that Cartwright$
had purchased the property. Though his system of finance might not$
commend itself to the barons and even the baronets of Capel Court, there$
was no question of his honesty.$
$
Was it by some extraordinary fluke that Maxell, who had hitherto shared$
in the profits of promotion, had kept aloof from this last and greatest$
of CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys flutters? No application for shares was ever found. He$
heard (he said at a subsequent inquiry) in a round-about way of the$
flotation, and saw a copy of the prospectus, and was a little worried.$
He knew that when he had left Cartwright in Paris, not only was the$
Brigot mine outside of his friendM-bM-^@M-^Ys control, but there was precious$
little prospect of bringing the Spaniard to a reasonable frame of mind.$
$
Cartwright must have done his work quickly, he thought, and have paid$
heavily; and this latter reflection worried him even more because he had$
a fairly accurate idea as to the condition of CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys private$
finances. His private thoughts on this occasion are set forth in the$
report of the Attorney-GeneralM-bM-^@M-^Ys Committee of Investigation.$
$
He was eating his solitary dinner in Cavendish Square when the telephone$
bell rang and the voice of Sir Gregory Fane, the Attorney-General,$
saluted him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I should like to see you, Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Will you come round to$
Clarges Street after dinner?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Certainly,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Maxell promptly, and hung up the receiver,$
wondering what new difficulties had arisen, which called for a$
consultation; for he was not on visiting terms with Mr. Attorney.$
$
In the tiny drawing-room of the house occupied by the Cabinet Minister,$
Maxell was surprised to find another visitor waitingM-bM-^@M-^Tno less a person$
than Fenshaw, the Prime MinisterM-bM-^@M-^Ys private secretary.$
$
The Attorney-General came straight to the point.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\we want your seat in the House of Commons.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The deuce you do!M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, raising his eyebrows.$
$
The Attorney nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We also want to give you some reward for the excellent services you$
have rendered to the Government,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\But mostlyM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^This eyes$
twinkledM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\it is necessary to find a seat for Sir Milton BoydM-bM-^@M-^Tthe$
Minister of Education has been defeated at a by-election, as you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The other nodded. The communication was a surprise to him and he$
wondered exactly what position was to be offered him which would involve$
his resignation from the House. For one brief, panicky moment he had$
connected Cartwright and his delinquencies with this request for an$
interview, but the AttorneyM-bM-^@M-^Ys speech had dispelled that momentary fear.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Quilland, as you know, has been raised to the Court of Appeal,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
the Attorney, speaking of a well-known Chancery Judge, M-bM-^@M-^\and we are$
departing from our usual practice by bringing over a man from the KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
Bench to take his place. Now, Maxell, how does a judgeship appeal to$
you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The K.C. could only stare.$
$
Of the many things he did not expect, it was elevation to the Bench,$
although he was a sound, good lawyer, and the Bench is the ambition of$
every silk.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I would like that,M-bM-^@M-^] he said huskily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Good!M-bM-^@M-^] said the brisk Attorney. M-bM-^@M-^\Then we will regard it as settled. The$
appointment will not be announced for two or three days, so youM-bM-^@M-^Yve a$
chance of clearing up your more urgent work and preparing a letter for$
your constituents. You might say a kind word for the new candidate who$
isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt particularly popular in your part of the world.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
One of MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys first acts was to write a letter to Cartwright. All$
CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys correspondence went to his London office, and was forwarded$
under separate cover to Paris. It was a long letter, recapitulating$
their friendly relationship, and ending:$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\This promotion, of course, means that we can no longer be$
    associated in business, and I have instructed my broker to sell$
    all the shares I possess in your and other companies forthwith.$
    As you know, I have very definite views about the high prestige$
    of the Bench; and whilst, in any circumstances, I feel that I$
    can go to that dignified position with clean hands, my mind will$
    be freer if I cut all the cords which hold me to commerce of$
    every shape and description.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Three days later the letter came to Cartwright, and he read it through$
with a thoughtful expression on his face. He read it twice before he$
slowly folded it and put it into his inside pocket.$
$
Maxell was to be made a Judge!$
$
He had never considered that contingency, and did not know whether to be$
pleased or sorry. He was losing the service of a man who had been a$
directing force in his life, greater than Maxell himself ever imagined.$
It was not so much the advice which he asked and received from the$
KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys Counsel, but rather Cartwright had secured help by the simple$
process of making a study of the otherM-bM-^@M-^Ys moods and expressions.$
$
He knew the half-frown which greeted some schemes, put forward$
tentatively over the dinner table, and it was that little sign of$
displeasure which could squash the scheme rather than any considered$
advice which Maxell might have given. He was losing a good advocate, a$
very sound legal adviser. He shrugged his shoulders. Well, it did not$
matter very much. Fate had put a period to an old phase of life, and$
many things had come to an end coincidently. He was taking his afternoon$
tea when the letter had arrived, and the new Mrs. Cartwright marked with$
interest the depression which followed the arrival of the mail.$
$
The new period was beginning excitingly, he thought. He had found a new$
method of doing business, bolder and more desperate than any he had$
attempted before; and with this development he had lost a man upon whom$
he placed a great deal of reliance. Incidentally, he had just been$
married, but this fact did not bulk very largely in his reckoning.$
Maxell might serve him yet. The memory of an old business$
partnershipM-bM-^@M-^Tfor in such an aspect did Cartwright interpret their$
previous relationshipM-bM-^@M-^Tthe memory, too, of favours done, of financial$
dangers shared, might serve him well if things went wrong. Maxell had a$
pull with the GovernmentM-bM-^@M-^Ta greater pull, since he was now a Judge of$
the Supreme Court.$
$
Maxell a Judge! It seemed queer. Cartwright had all the properly$
constituted EnglishmanM-bM-^@M-^Ys reverence for the Bench. In spite of much$
experience in litigation, and an acquaintance with lawyers of all kinds$
and stations, he reserved his awe for the god-like creature who sat in$
wig and gown, and dispensed justice evenhandedly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Have you had a worrying letter?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
$
He shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, no,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, a little impatiently; M-bM-^@M-^\it is nothing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She had hoped for a glimpse of the envelope, but was disappointed.$
Curiously enough, she ascribed the fact that her husband passed under a$
strange name and would not divulge his own, to a cause which was far$
from the truth, and was a great injustice to a man who, if he had not$
given her his proper name, had given her a title to whatever name he$
had. That thought she revealed for the first time.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know what I think?M-bM-^@M-^] she said unexpectedly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know you thought very much,M-bM-^@M-^] he smiled. M-bM-^@M-^\In what particular$
department of speculation does your mind wander?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt be sarcastic,M-bM-^@M-^] she answered. She was a little afraid of sarcasm,$
as are all children and immature grown-ups. M-bM-^@M-^\It was about your name I$
was thinking.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He frowned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why the dickens donM-bM-^@M-^Yt you leave my name alone?M-bM-^@M-^] he snapped. M-bM-^@M-^\I have$
told you that it is all for your good that IM-bM-^@M-^Ym called Benson and known$
as Benson in this town. When we go to London you will discover my name.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know why you keep it dark.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He looked at her sharply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why do I keep it dark?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked, fixing his eyes on her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Because youM-bM-^@M-^Yre married already.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He looked at her for a moment, and then burst into such a peal of$
laughter that the girl knew her shot was wide of the mark.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a weird person,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, getting up. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going out to see an$
old friend of ours.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of ours?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked suspiciously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Brigot is the gentlemanM-bM-^@M-^Ys name.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt see you,M-bM-^@M-^] she said decidedly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt he?M-bM-^@M-^] said the grim man. M-bM-^@M-^\I rather think he will.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M. Brigot would not willingly have received one whose name was anathema,$
but Cartwright got over the difficulty of his reception by the simple$
process of sending up a card inscribed with the name of BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys lawyer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You!M-bM-^@M-^] spluttered M. Brigot, rising to his feet as the other entered the$
room and closed the door behind him. M-bM-^@M-^\This is an outrage! It is$
monstrous! You will leave this house immediately, or I will send for the$
police!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, just keep quiet for a moment, Brigot,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, seating$
himself coolly. M-bM-^@M-^\I have come to see you as one business man to another.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I refuse to discuss any business with you,M-bM-^@M-^] stormed his unwilling host.$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are a scoundrel, a conspiratorM-bM-^@M-^Tbah! why do I talk to you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Because youM-bM-^@M-^Yre broke!M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright in calm, level tones, and he$
used the Spanish word for M-bM-^@M-^\broke,M-bM-^@M-^] which is so much more expressive than$
any word in English.$
$
The conversation was carried on in this language, for Cartwright had an$
intimate knowledge of its idioms and even of its patois.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Your creditors in Paris are gathering round like hawks about a dead$
cow. Your attempt to sell your Moorish property has been a failure.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You know a great deal,M-bM-^@M-^] sneered Brigot. M-bM-^@M-^\Possibly you also know that I$
am going to work the mine myself.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Englishman chuckled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve heard that said of you for years,M-bM-^@M-^] said he, M-bM-^@M-^\but the truth is,$
youM-bM-^@M-^Yre wholly incapable of working anything. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre one of natureM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
little spendersM-bM-^@M-^Tnow, Brigot, donM-bM-^@M-^Yt let us quarrel. There is a time to$
end feuds like ours, and this is that time. I am a business man, and so$
are you. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre as anxious to sell your property at a good price as I am$
to buy it. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve come to make you an offer.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M. Brigot laughed sarcastically.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ten thousand pounds?M-bM-^@M-^] he demanded with gentle irony. M-bM-^@M-^\To build a house$
for a beautiful American widow, eh?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright accepted the gibe with a smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not going to show you my hand,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It will be infamously dirty,M-bM-^@M-^] said M. Brigot, who was in his bright six$
oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock mood.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know there is gold in the Angera,M-bM-^@M-^] the other went on, without$
troubling to notice the interruption, M-bM-^@M-^\and I know that, properly worked,$
your mine may pay big profits.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I will sell out,M-bM-^@M-^] said M. Brigot after consideration, M-bM-^@M-^\but at a price.$
I have told you before I will sell outM-bM-^@M-^Tat a price.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But what a price!M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright, raising his eyebrows and with a$
gesture of extravagant despair. M-bM-^@M-^\It is all the money in the world!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nevertheless, it is the price,M-bM-^@M-^] said M. Brigot comfortably.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell you what I am willing to do.M-bM-^@M-^] Cartwright stroked his chin as$
though the solution had just occurred to him. M-bM-^@M-^\I will float your$
property in London, tacking on a number of other properties which I have$
bought in the neighbourhood. I am willing to pay you two hundred$
thousand poundsM-bM-^@M-^Tthat is to say, six million francs.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M. Brigot was interested. He was so interested that, for the moment, he$
could forget his animosity and private grievances. It was true that, as$
Cartwright had said, his creditors were becoming noisy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In cash, of course?M-bM-^@M-^] he said suddenly.$
$
Cartwright shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You can have a portion in cash and the rest in shares.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Bah!M-bM-^@M-^] Brigot snapped his fingers. M-bM-^@M-^\I also can issue shares, my friend.$
What are shares? Pieces of paper which are not worth their ink. No, no,$
you deceive me. I thought you had come to me with a genuine offer. There$
is no business to be done between you and me, Mr. Cartwright. Good$
evening.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright did not move.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A portion in cashM-bM-^@M-^Tsay, fifteen thousand pounds,M-bM-^@M-^] he suggested; M-bM-^@M-^\that$
is a lot of money.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\To youM-bM-^@M-^Tyes, but not to me,M-bM-^@M-^] said the magnificent Brigot. M-bM-^@M-^\Give me$
two-thirds in cash and I will take the rest in shares. That is my last$
word.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright rose.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This offer is open untilM-bM-^@M-^Twhen?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Until to-morrow at this hour,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Brigot.$
$
As Cartwright was going, a man tapped at the door. It was BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
M-bM-^@M-^\secretary,M-bM-^@M-^] who was also his valet. He handed a telegram to the$
Spaniard, and Brigot opened and read. He was a long time digesting its$
contents, and Cartwright waited for a favourable opportunity to say$
good-bye. All the time his mind was working, and he thought he saw$
daylight. Two-thirds of the money could be raised, and he could breathe$
again.$
$
Presently Brigot folded up the telegram and put it in his pocket, and$
there was on his face a beatific smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Good night, SeM-CM-1or Brigot,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\I will see you to-morrow$
with the money.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It will have to be big money, my friend,M-bM-^@M-^] said Brigot, and there was a$
note of exultation in his voice. M-bM-^@M-^\To buy my little property will cost$
you half a million English pounds.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright gasped.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you mean?M-bM-^@M-^] he demanded quickly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know Solomon Brothers, the financiers of London?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know them very well,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Cartwright steadily. He had good reason$
to know Solomon Brothers, who had taken a large block of shares in his$
new syndicate.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have just had a telegram from Solomon Brothers,M-bM-^@M-^] said SeM-CM-1or Brigot,$
speaking slowly, M-bM-^@M-^\and they ask me to give them the date when my property$
was transferred to your syndicate. They tell me it is included in your$
properties which you have floated. You know best, Mr. Cartwright,$
whether my little mine is worth half a million English pounds to$
youM-bM-^@M-^Tespecially if I put a date agreeable to you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Blackmail, eh?M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright between his teeth, and without a word$
left the room.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER VII$
$
$
HE went straight back to his flat on the Avenue of the Grand Army, and$
the girl could see by his face that something had happened.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You might pack my bag, will you?M-bM-^@M-^] he said almost brusquely. M-bM-^@M-^\I have a$
letter or two to write. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to London. Important business has$
arisen, and I may be gone some time.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Wisely she asked no questions, but carried out his instructions. When$
she came back from the room with a little gripsack packed, he was$
blotting the envelope of the last letter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Post these after I have gone,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shall I come down to the station and see you off?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The less you and I are seen together, the better, I think,M-bM-^@M-^] he said$
with a faint smile.$
$
He opened a drawer of his desk and took out a cash-box. From this he$
extracted a thick wad of notes, and, counting them rapidly, he tossed a$
respectable bundle into her lap.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You may want this,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\You know you have a regular income, but$
you must keep in touch with the Lyonnais. For the moment I should advise$
you to go toM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^The looked at the ceiling for inspirationM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\to Nice or$
Monte Carlo. Keep away from the tables,M-bM-^@M-^] he added humorously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ButM-bM-^@M-^Tbut,M-bM-^@M-^] said the bewildered girl, M-bM-^@M-^\for how long will you be gone?$
CanM-bM-^@M-^Yt I come with you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is impossible,M-bM-^@M-^] he said sharply. M-bM-^@M-^\You must go to the South of$
France, leave by to-nightM-bM-^@M-^Ys train. Give your address to nobody, and take$
another name if necessary.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are things very wrong?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Pretty bad,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\But donM-bM-^@M-^Yt worry. I may be gone for a year, even$
more. There are plenty of things you can do, but donM-bM-^@M-^Yt go back into the$
profession yet awhile.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I thought of taking up cinema work,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You might do worse than go to AmericaM-bM-^@M-^Tif I am a long time gone.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He stuffed the remainder of the notes into his pocket, picked up his$
bag, and with no other farewell than a curt nod, left her.$
$
She was only to see him once again in her life-time.$
$
He crossed the Channel by the night boat and came to London in the early$
hours of the morning. He drove straight away to his hotel, had a bath$
and shaved. His plan was fairly well formed. Everything depended upon$
the charity which Messrs. Solomon Brothers might display towards his$
strange lapse.$
$
At breakfast he read in _The Times_ that M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Justice Maxell took his$
seat upon the BenchM-bM-^@M-^] on the previous day, and that paragraph, for some$
reason, seemed to cheer him.$
$
At ten oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock he was in the City. At half-past ten he was interviewing$
the senior partner of Solomon Brothers, a man with an expressionless$
face, who listened courteously to the somewhat lame excuses which$
Cartwright offered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was a mistake of a blundering clerk,M-bM-^@M-^] said Cartwright airily. M-bM-^@M-^\As$
soon as I discovered the error, I came back to London to withdraw all$
the money which had been subscribed.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is a pity you didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt come back yesterday, Mr. Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Solomon.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you mean?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I mean,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other, M-bM-^@M-^\that we have already placed this matter in$
the hands of our solicitors. I suggest that you had better interview$
them.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright made a further pilgrimage to the solicitors of Solomon$
Brothers, and found them most unwilling to see him. That was an ominous$
sign, and he went back to his office in Victoria Street conscious that a$
crisis was at hand. At any rate, the girl was out of the way; but, what$
was more important, she, one of the principal witnesses in so far as$
Brigot and his property were concerned, was not available for those who$
might bring a charge against him. She was his wife, and her lips were$
sealed, and this consequence of his marriage was one which he had not$
wholly overlooked when he had contracted his strange alliance.$
$
What a fool he had been! The property might have been transferred and in$
his hands, if he had not antagonised a wretched little Spanish$
theatrical manager. But, he reflected, if he had not antagonised that$
manager, he would not have possessed the instrument for extracting the$
transfer from the amorous Brigot.$
$
At the top of a heap of letters awaiting him was one written in a firm$
boyish hand, and Cartwright made a little grimace, as though for the$
first time recognising his responsibility.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take A Chance Anderson; my lad, you will have to take a chance,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said, and pushed the letter aside unopened.$
$
He lunched at his club, sent a brief letter to Maxell, and returned to$
his office at two in the afternoon. His clerk told him that a man was$
waiting for him in the inner office. Cartwright hesitated with his hand$
on the door; then, setting his teeth, he stepped in.$
$
The stranger rose.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are you Mr. Alfred Cartwright?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is my name,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I am Inspector Guilbury, of the City Police,M-bM-^@M-^] said the stranger, M-bM-^@M-^\and I$
shall take you into custody on charges under the Companies Act, and a$
further charge of conspiracy to defraud.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Go ahead,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
                 *        *        *        *        *$
$
All the week preceding the trial, CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys heart was filled with$
warm, gratitude to his erstwhile friend. He did not doubt, when his$
solicitor told him that Mr. Justice Maxell would try his case, that$
Maxell had gone a long way out of his way to get himself appointed the$
Old Bailey judge. How like Maxell it wasM-bM-^@M-^Tthat queer, solemn stickM-bM-^@M-^Tand$
how loyal!$
$
Cartwright had a feeling for Maxell which he had never had before. At$
first he had feared the embarrassment which might be MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys at having$
to try a case in which an old friend was implicated, and had even hoped$
that the new judge would have nothing to do with the trial. He did not$
despair of Maxell pulling strings on his behalf, and he realised that$
much could be done by judicious lobbying.$
$
The charge against him was a grave one. He had not realised how serious$
it was until he had seen that respectful array of counsel in the Lord$
MayorM-bM-^@M-^Ys Court, and had heard his misdemeanours reduced to cold legal$
phraseology. But he did not wholly despair. Brigot had been coming to$
London to give evidence, and on his journey there had occurred an$
incident which suggested to the accused man that Providence was fighting$
on his side. The Spaniard had had a stroke in the train to Calais, and$
the doctors reported that he might not recover. Not that BrigotM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
evidence was indispensable. There was, apparently, a letter and two$
telegrams in existence, in the course of which Brigot denied that he had$
ever parted with his property; and the onus lay upon Cartwright to prove$
that he had acted in a _bona fide_ mannerM-bM-^@M-^Tthat was impossible of proof,$
and nobody knew this better than Cartwright.$
$
And ever his mind reverted to the singular act of generosity on the part$
of his old friend. He did not doubt for one moment that Maxell had$
M-bM-^@M-^\workedM-bM-^@M-^] the case so that it fell to him to try it.$
$
It was a bright morning in May when he came up the steps of the Old$
Bailey and took his place in the dock. Almost immediately after, the$
Judge and the Sheriff entered from the door behind the plain oaken$
bench. How well the judicial robes became Maxell, thought Cartwright. He$
bowed slightly and received as slight a bow in reply. Maxell was looking$
pale. His face was drawn, and there was resolution in his speech and in$
his eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Before this case proceeds,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\I wish to direct attention to a$
statement in one of the newspapers this morning, that I was associated$
with the accused in business, and that I am in some way involved,$
directly or indirectly, in the company promotionM-bM-^@M-^Teither as a$
shareholder or an indirect promoterM-bM-^@M-^Twhich is the subject of the present$
charge. I wish to utter an emphatic denial to that statement.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He spoke clearly and slowly and looked the prisoner straight in the eye,$
and Cartwright nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I can only endorse your lordshipM-bM-^@M-^Ys statement,M-bM-^@M-^] he said emphatically.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Your lordship has never had any dealings with me or any business$
transactions whatsoever.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was a minor sensation which provided a headline for the evening$
newspapers. The case proceeded. It was not particularly involved and the$
witnesses were few but vital. There were those business men who had$
subscribed or promised to subscribe to the syndicate. There was Mr.$
Solomon, who could give an account of his dealings with the prisoner.$
But, most damning of all, was a sworn statement made by Brigot before an$
English solicitor, a Commissioner of Oaths. And it was such a statement$
which only documentary proof, produced by the accused man, could refute.$
$
Cartwright listened to the evidence untroubled of mind. He knew that his$
counselM-bM-^@M-^Ys speech, delivered with such force, was little less than an$
admission of guilt and a plea for mercy. The last word would be with the$
judge. A verdict of M-bM-^@M-^\guiltyM-bM-^@M-^] there must necessarily be. But he thought$
that, when later his counsel pleaded for a minimum sentence, he saw a$
responsive look in the JudgeM-bM-^@M-^Ys eyes.$
$
The stigma of imprisonment did not greatly distress Cartwright. He had$
lived on the narrow border-line of illegalities too long; he had weighed$
chances and penalties too nicely to bother about such ephemeral things$
as M-bM-^@M-^\honour.M-bM-^@M-^] His system of finance was reviewed, and certain minor$
charges arising out of the manipulation of funds were gone into. It was$
late in the evening when the Judge began his summing up.$
$
It was a fair, if a conventional address he delivered to the jury.$
Obviously, thought Cartwright, he could do nothing less than call$
attention to the serious nature of the charge, the interests involved,$
the betrayal of shareholders, and the like. On the whole, the summing up$
did not diminish the comforting sense that the worst that lay before him$
was a few monthsM-bM-^@M-^Y imprisonment and then a start in another land under$
another name. He never doubted his ability to make money. The summing up$
was ended, and the jury retired. They were gone twenty minutes, and when$
they came back it was a foregone conclusion what their verdict would be.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Guilty,M-bM-^@M-^] was the reply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And is that the verdict of you all?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Justice Maxell was examining his notes, and presently he closed the$
little book which he was consulting.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The charge against Alfred Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\is one of the most$
serious which could be brought against a business man. The jury have$
returned a verdict of guilty, and I must say that I concur in that$
verdict. I am here in my placeM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^This voice shook a littleM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\to$
administer and maintain the laws of England. I must do all that in me is$
possible to preserve the purity of commercial life and the condition of$
English commercial honesty.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright waited for that M-bM-^@M-^\butM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tit did not come.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In view of the seriousness of the frauds and irregularities which the$
accused has committed, with a cynical disregard for the happiness or$
fortune of those people whose interests should have been his own, I$
cannot do less than pass a sentence which will serve as an example to$
all wrongdoers.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright gasped and gripped the edge of the dock.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You, Alfred Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, and again looked him straight in$
the eye, M-bM-^@M-^\will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright swallowed something. Then he leaned across the edge of the$
dock.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You swine!M-bM-^@M-^] he said huskily, and then the warders dragged him away.$
$
Two days later there was a new sensation. The newspapers announced that$
Mr. Justice Maxell had been compelled, on account of ill-health, to$
resign from the Bench, and that His Majesty had been pleased to confer a$
baronetcy of the United Kingdom upon the ex-Judge.$

                              CHAPTER VIII$
$
$
SOME nine years after the events detailed in the last chapter, a$
fairly clever young actress who had drifted into the cinematograph$
business, faced one of the many disappointments which had made up her$
life. In many ways the disappointment was more bitter than any she had$
previously experienced, because she had banked so heavily upon success.$
$
If there was any satisfaction to be had out of the new tragedy it was to$
be found in the fact that the fault was not entirely hers. An impartial$
critic might, indeed, absolve her from all responsibility.$
$
In this particular instance she regarded herself in the light of a$
martyr to indifferent literatureM-bM-^@M-^Tnot without reason.$
$
When the Westminster Art Film Company was tottering on its last legs,$
Mr. Willie Ellsberger, chairman and chief victim, decided on one big$
throw for fortune. The play decided upon does not matter, because it was$
written by Willie himself, with the assistance of his advertising man,$
but it contained all the stunts that had ever got by in all the photo$
plays that had ever been produced, and in and out of every breathless$
situation flashed Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady, the most amazing, the most charming,$
the most romantic, the highest salaried artiste that filmland had ever$
known.$
$
Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady had come to London from Honolulu, after she had inherited$
her fatherM-bM-^@M-^Ys considerable fortune. She came, a curious visitor, to the$
studios, merely as a spectator, and had laughingly refused Mr.$
EllsbergerM-bM-^@M-^Ys first offer, that gentleman having been attracted by her$
perfect face and the grace of her movements; but at last, after$
extraordinary persuasion, she had agreed to star in that stupendous$
production, M-bM-^@M-^\The Soul of Babylon,M-bM-^@M-^] for a fee of M-BM-#25,000, which was to be$
distributed amongst certain Honolulu charities in which she was$
interested.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] she told a newspaper man, M-bM-^@M-^\this is to be my first and my last$
film. I enjoy the work very much, but naturally it takes up a great deal$
of my time.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are you returning to Honolulu?M-bM-^@M-^] asked our representative.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady, M-bM-^@M-^\I am going on to Paris. My agent has bought$
me the Duc de MontpelierM-bM-^@M-^Ys house in the Avenue dM-bM-^@M-^YEtoile.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
A week after the picture was finished, Miss Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady waited on the$
chairman by appointment.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, Sadie,M-bM-^@M-^] said that gentleman, leaning back in his chair, and$
smiling unhappily, M-bM-^@M-^\itM-bM-^@M-^Ys a flivver!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt say!M-bM-^@M-^] said Sadie aghast.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We ran it off for the big renter from the North, and he says it is$
about as bad as it can be, and that all the good in it is so obviously$
stolen, that he dare not risk the injunction which would follow the$
first exhibition. Did Simmonds pay you your last weekM-bM-^@M-^Ys salary?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, Mr. Ellsberger,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl.$
$
Ellsberger shrugged.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That sets me back another twenty pounds,M-bM-^@M-^] he said and reached for his$
cheque-book. M-bM-^@M-^\It is tough on you, Sadie, but itM-bM-^@M-^Ys tougher on us. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not$
so sure that it is so tough on you, though. I spent a fortune$
advertising you. There isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt anybody in this country who hasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt heard of$
Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady, and,M-bM-^@M-^] he added grimly, M-bM-^@M-^\youM-bM-^@M-^Yve more publicity than I hope$
I shall get when this business goes into the hands of the Official$
Receiver.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no more work?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl after a pause.$
$
Mr. EllsbergerM-bM-^@M-^Ys hands said: M-bM-^@M-^\What can I do?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You ought not to have any difficulty in getting a shop,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\with$
your figure.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Especially when the figureM-bM-^@M-^Ys twenty pounds a week,M-bM-^@M-^] she said$
unsmilingly. M-bM-^@M-^\I was a fool ever to leave Paris. I was doing well there$
and I wish IM-bM-^@M-^Yd never heard of the cinema business.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Still young and pretty and slim, with a straight nose and a straighter$
mouth, she had no appeal for Mr. Ellsberger, who in matters of business$
had an unsympathetic nature.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why donM-bM-^@M-^Yt you go back to Paris?M-bM-^@M-^] he said, speaking very deliberately$
and looking out of the window. M-bM-^@M-^\Perhaps that affair has blown over by$
now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What affair?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked sharply. M-bM-^@M-^\What do you mean?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve friends in Paris,M-bM-^@M-^] said the chairman, M-bM-^@M-^\good, bright boys who go$
around a lot, and they know most of whatM-bM-^@M-^Ys going on in town.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked at him, biting her lips thoughtfully.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Reggie van RhynM-bM-^@M-^TthatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the trouble you heard about?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Ellsberger nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what happened, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yll never believe in a thousand years$
that I stabbed him,M-bM-^@M-^] she said vigorously. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve always been too much of$
a lady for that sort of thingM-bM-^@M-^TI was educated at a convent.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Ellsberger yawned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take that to Curtis, will you,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\If he can get any free$
publicity for you, why, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll be glad. Now take my adviceM-bM-^@M-^Tstay on. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
put Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady way up amongst the well-known products of Movieland,$
and youM-bM-^@M-^Yll be a fool if you quit just when the public is getting$
interested in you. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym in bad, but that doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt affect you, Sadie, and$
there ainM-bM-^@M-^Yt a producer in England who wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt jump at you and give you$
twice the salary IM-bM-^@M-^Ym paying.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She stood up, undecided. Ellsberger was growing weary of the interview.$
He made a great show of pulling out notepaper and rang the bell for his$
stenographer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The publicityM-bM-^@M-^Ys fine,M-bM-^@M-^] she admitted, M-bM-^@M-^\and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve felt good about the$
work. Why the letters that IM-bM-^@M-^Yve had from people asking for my autograph$
and pictures of my Honolulu estateM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tshe smiled a little$
frostilyM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\people in society, too. Why, a titled man who wrote to me$
from Bournemouth, Sir John MaxellM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Ellsberger was interested, indeed, he was fascinated. He waved away$
his stenographer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sit down, Sadie,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre sure it was Maxell? Sir John$
Maxell?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys him,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys class there.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys money, too,M-bM-^@M-^] said the practical Ellsberger. M-bM-^@M-^\Why donM-bM-^@M-^Yt you$
get in touch with him, Sadie? A fellow like that would think nothing of$
putting ten thousand into a picture if he was interested in a girl. If$
you happen to be the girl, Sadie, thereM-bM-^@M-^Yll be a thousand pound contract$
for you right away.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Her straight lips were a trifle hard.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What you want is an angel, and the Judge is the best kind of angel you$
could wish for.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Has he got money?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Money!M-bM-^@M-^] said the hands of Ellsberger. M-bM-^@M-^\What a ridiculous question to$
ask!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Money!M-bM-^@M-^] he scoffed. M-bM-^@M-^\Money to burn. Do you mean to say youM-bM-^@M-^Yve never$
heard of Sir John Maxell, never heard of the man who sent his best$
friend to gaol for twenty years? Why, it was the biggest sensation of$
the year!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sadie was not very interested in history, but momentarily, by virtue of$
the very warm and well punctuated letter which reposed in her bag, she$
was interested in Sir John.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is he married?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl naturally.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He is not married,M-bM-^@M-^] said Ellsberger emphatically.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Any children?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There are no children, but he has a nieceM-bM-^@M-^TheM-bM-^@M-^Ys got some legal$
responsibility as regards her; I remember seeing it in the newspapers,$
heM-bM-^@M-^Ys her guardian or something.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Ellsberger looked at the girl with a speculative eye.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Have you his letter?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She nodded and produced the epistle.$
$
It was polite but warm. It had some reference to her M-bM-^@M-^\gracious talent,M-bM-^@M-^]$
to her M-bM-^@M-^\unexampled beautyM-bM-^@M-^] which had M-bM-^@M-^\brought pleasure to one who was no$
longer influenced by the commonplace,M-bM-^@M-^] and it finished up by expressing$
the hope that they two would meet in the early future, and that before$
leaving for Paris she would honour him by being his guest for a few$
days.$
$
Ellsberger handed the letter back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Write him,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and, Sadie, consider yourself engaged for another$
weekM-bM-^@M-^Twrite to him in my time. HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys fallen for all that Press stuff, and$
maybe, if heM-bM-^@M-^Ys got that passionate admiration for your genius$
heM-bM-^@M-^YllM-bM-^@M-^Tsay, you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want to stay in the picture business and finish by$
marrying that kind of trouble, do you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He pointed through the wide windows to a youth who was coming across$
from the studio to the office, swinging a cane vigorously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Observe the lavender socks and the wrist watch,M-bM-^@M-^] he chuckled. M-bM-^@M-^\But$
donM-bM-^@M-^Yt make any mistake about Timothy Anderson. HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys the toughest amateur$
at his weight in this or any other state and a good boy, but heM-bM-^@M-^Ys the$
kind of fellow that women like you marryM-bM-^@M-^Tget acquainted with the$
Judge.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
With only a preliminary knock, which he did not wait to hear answered,$
the young man had swung through the door, hat in hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How do, Miss OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady?M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I saw your pictureM-bM-^@M-^Tfine! Good acting,$
but a perfectly rotten play. I suppose you wrote it, Ellsberger?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wrote it,M-bM-^@M-^] admitted that gentleman gloomily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It bears the impression of your genius, old bird.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy Anderson shook his head reproachfully.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It only wanted you as the leading man, and it would have been dead$
before we put the titles in,M-bM-^@M-^] said Ellsberger with a grin.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym out of the movies for good,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy Anderson, sitting himself$
on a table. M-bM-^@M-^\It is a demoralising occupationM-bM-^@M-^Twhich reminds me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He slipped from the table, thrust his hand into his pocket, and$
producing a roll of notes:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I owe you twenty-five pounds, Ellsberger,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Thank you very$
much. You saved me from ruin and starvation.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He counted the money across, and Mr. Ellsberger was undoubtedly$
surprised and made no attempt to conceal the fact. So surprised was he$
that he could be jocose.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Fixed a big contract with Mary Pickford?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\N-no,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\but I struck a roulette gameM-bM-^@M-^Tand took a chance.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Took a chance again, eh?M-bM-^@M-^] said Ellsberger. M-bM-^@M-^\One of these days youM-bM-^@M-^Yll$
take a chance and never get better of it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Pooh!M-bM-^@M-^] said the other in derision. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you think thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys any new$
experience for me? Not on your life. I went into this game with just$
twelve pounds and my hotel bill three weeks in arrears. I was down to my$
last half-crown, but I played it and came out with three hundred$
pounds.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Whose game was it?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Mr. Ellsberger curiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Tony Smail,M-bM-^@M-^] and Mr. Ellsberger whistled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys one of the toughest places in town,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\It is a$
wonder you came away with the moneyM-bM-^@M-^Tand your life.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I took a chance,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other carelessly, and swung his legs once$
more over the edge of the desk. M-bM-^@M-^\There was some slight trouble when I$
came out of SmailM-bM-^@M-^Ys,M-bM-^@M-^] he shrugged his shoulders, M-bM-^@M-^\just a little$
horseplay.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl had followed the conversation keenly. Any talk which circled$
about finance had the effect of concentrating her attention.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you always take a chance?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Always,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other promptly.$
$
This woman did not appeal to him. Timothy possessed a seventh sense$
which he called his M-bM-^@M-^\Sorter,M-bM-^@M-^] and Miss Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady was already sorted$
into the heap of folks who, had life been a veritable voyage, would have$
been labelled M-bM-^@M-^\Not Wanted.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He held out his hand to Ellsberger.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going by the next boat to New York,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\then IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go to$
California. Maybe IM-bM-^@M-^Yll take in Kempton on my way, for a fellow I met at$
the hotel has a horse running which can catch pigeons. Good-bye, Miss$
OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady. I wish you every kind of luck.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She watched him disappear, sensing his antagonism and responding$
thereto. If he could judge women by intuition, she judged him by reason,$
and she knew that here was a man whose mental attitude was one of$
dormant hostility.$
$
It would be unfair to her to say that it was because she recognised the$
clean mind and the healthy outlook and the high principles of this young$
man that she disliked him. She was not wholly bad, because she had been$
the victim of circumstances and had lately lived a two-thousand pound$
life on a one-hundred pound capacity. She looked after him, biting her$
lips as though she were solving a great problem.$
$
Presently she turned to Ellsberger.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll write to Sir John,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
By a curious coincidence Timothy Anderson had the idea of approaching$
Sir John Maxell also, though nearly a year passed before he carried his$
idea into execution.$

                               CHAPTER IX$
$
$
THE initials M-bM-^@M-^\T. A. C.M-bM-^@M-^] before young Mr. AndersonM-bM-^@M-^Ys name stood for$
Timothy Alfred Cartwright, his pious but practical parent having, by$
this combination, made a bid for the protection of the saints and the$
patronage of Cousin Al Cartwright, reputedly a millionaire and a$
bachelor. It was hoped in this manner that his position on earth and in$
heaven would be equally secure.$
$
What TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys chances are in the hereafter the reader must decide; but$
we do know that Cousin Al Cartwright proved both a weak reed and a$
whited sepulchre. TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys parents had departed this life two years$
after Alfred Cartwright had disappeared from public view, leaving behind$
him two yearsM-bM-^@M-^Y work for a committee of Investigating Accounts.$
$
When his surviving parent died, the boy was at school, and if he was not$
a prodigy of learning he was at least brilliant in parts.$
$
Though it was with no great regret that he left school, he was old$
enough and shrewd enough to realise that a bowing acquaintance with the$
differential calculus, and the ability to conjugate the verb M-bM-^@M-^\avoirM-bM-^@M-^] did$
not constitute an equipment, sufficiently comprehensive (if you will$
forgive these long words), to meet and defeat such enemies to human$
progress as he was likely to meet in this cruel and unsympathetic world.$
$
He had a small income bequeathed by his mother in a will which was$
almost apologetic because she left so little, and he settled himself$
down as a boarder in the house of a schoolmaster, and took up those$
branches of study which interested him, and set himself to forget other$
branches of education which interested him not at all.$
$
Because of his ineradicable passion for challenging fate it was only$
natural that M-bM-^@M-^\T. A. C.M-bM-^@M-^] should bear a new significance, and since some$
genius had christened him M-bM-^@M-^\Take A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^] Anderson the name stuck. And$
he took chances. From every throw with fate he learnt something. He had$
acquired some knowledge of boxing at school, and had learnt enough of$
the art to enable him to head the school. Such was his faith in himself$
and his persuasive eloquence that he induced Sam Murphy,$
ex-middle-weight and proprietor of the StagM-bM-^@M-^Ys Head, Dorking, to nominate$
and support him for a ten-rounds contest with that redoubtable$
feather-weight, Bill Schenk.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^] Anderson took his chance. He also took the count in the$
first round, and, returning to consciousness, vowed a vowM-bM-^@M-^Tnot that he$
would never again enter the ring, but that he would learn something more$
of the game before he did. Of course, it was very disgraceful that a man$
of his antecedents should become a professional boxerM-bM-^@M-^Tfor professional$
he became in the very act of failureM-bM-^@M-^Tbut that worried him not at all.$
$
It is a matter of history that Bill Schenk was knocked out by Kid$
Muldoon, and that twelve months after his initiation into the prize ring$
M-bM-^@M-^\T. AndersonM-bM-^@M-^] fought twenty rounds with the Kid and got the decision on$
points. Thereafter, the ring knew M-bM-^@M-^\Take A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^] Anderson no more.$
$
He took a chance on race-courses, backing horses that opened at tens and$
closed at twenties. He backed horses that had never won before on the$
assumption that they must win some time. He had sufficient money left$
after this adventure to buy a book of form. He devoted his undoubted$
talent to the study of other games of chance. He played cards for$
matches with a brokerM-bM-^@M-^Ys clerk, who harboured secret ambitions of going$
to Monte Carlo with a system; he purchased on the hire system$
wonderfully cheap properties on the Isle of ThanetM-bM-^@M-^Tand he worked.$
$
For all his fooling and experimenting, for all his gambling and his$
chancing, Timothy never let a job of work get past him, if he could do$
it, and when he wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt working for sordid lucre he was working for the$
good of his soul. He went to the races with a volume of MoliM-CM-(reM-bM-^@M-^Ys plays$
under his arm, and between events he read, hereby acquiring the respect$
of the racing fraternity as an earnest student of form.$
$
So he came by violent, yet to him easy, stages to MovielandM-bM-^@M-^Tthat Mecca$
which attracts all that is enterprising and romantic and restless. He$
took a chance in a juvenile lead, but his method and his style of$
actions were original. Producers are for ever on the look out for$
novelty, but they put the bar up against novel styles of acting and$
expression. Ellsberger had tried him out because he had known his$
father, but more because he had won money over him when he had beaten$
Kid Muldoon; but even Ellsberger was compelled to suggest that Timothy$
put in two long years M-bM-^@M-^\atmospheringM-bM-^@M-^] before he essayed an individual$
rM-CM-4le on the screen.$
$
Timothy was not certain whether his train left at ten minutes to seven$
or at ten minutes past seven, so he arrived in time for the ten minutes$
to seven, which was characteristic of him, because he never took a$
chance against the inflexible systems.$
$
He reached New York without misadventure, but on his way westward he$
stayed over at Nevada. He intended spending a night, but met a man with$
a scheme for running a mail-order business on entirely new lines,$
invested his money, and by some miracle managed to make it last a year.$
At the end of that time the police were after his partner, and Timothy$
was travelling eastward by easy stages.$
$
He came back to New York with fifty-five dollars which he had won from a$
Westerner on the last stage of the journey. The track ran for about$
twenty miles along the side of the road, the wager between them was a$
very simple one; it was whether they would pass more men than women on$
the road. The Westerner chose men and Timothy chose women. For every man$
they saw Timothy paid a dollar, for every woman he received a dollar. In$
the agreed hour they passed fifty-five more women than they passed men$
and Timothy was that many dollars richer. There were never so many women$
abroad as there were that bright afternoon, and the Westerner couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
understand it until he realised that it was SundayM-bM-^@M-^Ta fact which Timothy$
had grasped before he had made his wager.$
$
Two months later he was back in London. How he got back he never$
explained. He stayed in London only long enough to fit himself up with a$
new kit before he presented himself at a solid mansion in Branksome$
Park, Bournemouth. Years and years before, Sir John Maxell had written$
to him, asking him to call upon him for any help he might require, and$
promising to assist him in whatever difficulties he might find himself.$
Timothy associated the offer with the death of his fatherM-bM-^@M-^Tmaybe they$
were friends.$
$
He was shown into the sunny drawing-room bright with flowers, and he$
looked round approvingly. He had lived in other peopleM-bM-^@M-^Ys houses all his$
lifeM-bM-^@M-^Tschools, boarding-houses, hotels and the likeM-bM-^@M-^Tand an atmosphere$
of home came to him like the forgotten fragrance of a garden he had$
known.$
$
The servant came back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John will see you in ten minutes, sir, but you must not keep him$
long, because he has to go out to meet Lady Maxell.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Lady Maxell?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy in surprise, M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know he was$
married.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The servant smiled and said:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The Judge married a year ago, sir. It was in all the newspapers.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt read all the newspapers,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt sufficient$
time. Who was the lady?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The man looked round, as if fearing to be overheard.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John married the cinema lady, Miss Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGrady,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, and the$
hostility in his tone was unmistakable.$
$
Timothy gasped.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt say!M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Well, that beats the band! Why, I knew that$
daM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T, that lady in London!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The servant inclined his head sideways.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Indeed, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, and it was evident that he did not regard$
Timothy as being any fitter for human association by reason of his$
confession.$
$
A distant bell buzzed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John is ready, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I hope you will not mention the fact$
that I spoke of madam?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy winked, and was readmitted to the confidence of the democracy.$
$
Sir John Maxell was standing up behind his writing table, a fine, big$
man with his grey hair neatly brushed back from his forehead and his$
blue eyes magnified behind rimless glasses.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\T. A. C. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, coming round the table with slow steps.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Surely this is not the little Timothy I heard so much about years and$
years ago!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is I, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, well,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, M-bM-^@M-^\I should never have known you. Sit down, my$
boy. You smoke, of courseM-bM-^@M-^Teverybody smokes nowadays, but it seems$
strange that a boy I knew in short breeches should have acquired the$
habit. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve heard about you,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, as Timothy lit his cigar.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nothing to my discredit, I hope, sir?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Maxell shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have heard about you,M-bM-^@M-^] he repeated diplomatically, M-bM-^@M-^\let it go at$
that. Now I suppose youM-bM-^@M-^Yve come here because, five years ago, on the$
twenty-third of December to be correct, I wrote to you, offering to give$
you any help that lay in my power.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt swear to the date,M-bM-^@M-^] said Tim.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But I will,M-bM-^@M-^] smiled the other. M-bM-^@M-^\I never forget a date, I never forget a$
letter, I never forget the exact wording of that letter. My memory is an$
amazing gift. Now just tell me what I can do for you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy hesitated.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\I have had a pretty bad time in America. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been$
running in a team with a crook and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve had to pay out every cent I had$
in the world.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sir John nodded slowly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then it is money you want,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, without enthusiasm.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not exactly money, sir, but IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to try to start in London and I$
thought, maybe, you might give me a letter of introduction to somebody.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ah, well,M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell, brightening up, M-bM-^@M-^\I think I can do that for you.$
What did you think of doing in London?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I thought of getting some sort of secretarial job,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Not that$
I know much about it!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sir John pinched his lower lip.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know a man who may help you,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\We were in the House of$
Commons together and he would give you a place in one of his offices,$
but unfortunately for you he has made a great deal of money and spends$
most of his time at Newmarket.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds good to me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy M-bM-^@M-^\Why, IM-bM-^@M-^Yd take a chance$
there. Perhaps heM-bM-^@M-^Yd try me out in that office?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Judge permitted himself to smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In Newmarket,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\our friend does very little more, I fear, than$
waste his time and money on the race-course. He has half a dozen$
horsesM-bM-^@M-^TI had a letter from him this morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He walked back to his table, searched in the litter, and presently$
amongst the papers pulled out a letter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\As a matter of fact, I had some business with him and I wrote to him$
for information. The only thing he tells me isM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tthis with a gesture of$
despairM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\that Skyball and Polly ChawM-bM-^@M-^Tthose are the names of$
race-horses, I presumeM-bM-^@M-^Twill win the two big handicaps next week and$
that he has a flyer named Swift Kate that can beat anythingM-bM-^@M-^TI am$
quoting his wordsM-bM-^@M-^Ton legs over six furlongs.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He looked up over his glasses at Timothy, and on that young manM-bM-^@M-^Ys face$
was a seraphic smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Newmarket sounds real nice to me,M-bM-^@M-^] glowed Timothy.$
$
Remembering the injunctions of the servant, he was taking his adieu,$
when his host asked, in a lower voice than that in which the$
conversation had been carried on:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I suppose you have not heard from your cousin?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy looked at him in astonishment. Had Sir John asked after the$
Grand Llama of Tibet he would have been as well prepared to answer.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, no, sirM-bM-^@M-^TnoM-bM-^@M-^TerM-bM-^@M-^Tis he alive?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sir John Maxell looked at him sharply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Alive? Of course. I thought you might have heard from him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\he disappeared. I only met him once when I was a$
kid. Was he a friendM-bM-^@M-^TerM-bM-^@M-^Tan acquaintance of yours?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sir John was drumming his fingers on the desk and his mind was far away.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes and no,M-bM-^@M-^] he said shortly. M-bM-^@M-^\I knew him, and at one time I was$
friendly with him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Suddenly he glanced at his watch, and a look of consternation came to$
his face.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Great heavens!M-bM-^@M-^] he cried. M-bM-^@M-^\I promised to meet my wife a quarter of an$
hour ago. Good-bye! Good-bye!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He hand-shook Timothy from the room and the young man had to find his$
way downstairs without guidance, because the manservant was at that$
moment heavily engaged.$
$
From the floor below came a shrill, unpleasant sound, and Timothy$
descended to find himself in the midst of a domestic crisis. There were$
two ladies in the hallM-bM-^@M-^Tone a mere silent, contained spectator, the$
other the principal actress. He recognised her at once, but she did not$
see him, because her attention was directed to the red-faced servant.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\When I ring you on the M-bM-^@M-^Yphone, I expect to be answered,M-bM-^@M-^] she was$
saying. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve nothing to do except to sit round and keep your ears$
open, you big, lazy devil!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But, my lady, IM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt answer me,M-bM-^@M-^] she stormed. M-bM-^@M-^\If you think IM-bM-^@M-^Yve nothing better to do$
than to sit at a M-bM-^@M-^Yphone waiting till you wake up, why, youM-bM-^@M-^Yre$
mistakenM-bM-^@M-^TthatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all. And if Sir John doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt fire youM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt worry about Sir John firing me,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man with a sudden$
change of manner. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve just had about as much of you as I can stand.$
You keep your bossing for the movies, Lady Maxell. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre not going to$
try any of that stuff with me!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was incapable of further speech, nor was there any necessity for it$
since the man turned on his heels and disappeared into that mysterious$
region which lies at the back of every entrance hall. Then for the first$
time she saw Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How do you do, Lady Maxell?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She glared round at the interrupter, and for a moment he thought she$
intended venting her anger on him. She was still frowning when he took$
her limp hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre the Anderson boy, arenM-bM-^@M-^Yt you?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked a little ungraciously.$
$
The old sense of antagonism was revived and intensified in him at the$
touch of her hand. She was unchanged, looking, if anything, more pretty$
than when he had seen her last, but the hardness at her mouth was$
accentuated, and she had taken on an indefinable air of superiority$
which differed very little from sheer insolence.$
$
A gold-rimmed lorgnette came up to survey him, and he was nettledM-bM-^@M-^Tonly$
women had the power to annoy him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt changed a bit,M-bM-^@M-^] he bantered. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sorry your eyesight is$
not so good as it was. Studio life is pretty tough on the eyes, isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She closed her lorgnette with a snap, and turned to the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yd better see what Sir John is doing,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Ask him what he$
thinks I am, that I should wait in the hall like a tramp.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was then that the girl came out of the shadow and Timothy saw her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This is the ward or niece,M-bM-^@M-^] he said to himself, and sighed, for never$
had he seen a human creature who so satisfied his eye. There is a beauty$
which is neither statuesque nor cold, nor to be confounded with$
prettiness. It is a beauty which depends upon no regularity of feature$
or of colour, but which has its reason in its contradictions.$
$
The smiling Madonna whom Leonardo drew had such contradictory quality as$
this girl possessed. For she was ninety per cent. child, and carried in$
her face all the bubbling joy of youth. Yet she impressed Timothy as$
being strange and unnatural. Her meekness, her ready obedience to carry$
out the womanM-bM-^@M-^Ys instruction, the very dignity of her departureM-bM-^@M-^Tthese$
things did not fit with the character he read in her face. Had she$
turned curtly to this insolent woman and told her to carry her message$
herself, or had she flown up the stairs calling for Sir John as she$
went, these things would have been natural.$
$
Lady Maxell turned upon him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And see here, Mr. WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys-your-name, if youM-bM-^@M-^Yre a friend of Sir John,$
youM-bM-^@M-^Yll forget that I was ever in a studio. There are enough stories$
about me in Bournemouth without your adding to the collection.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\MotherM-bM-^@M-^Ys little thoroughbred!M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy admiringly; M-bM-^@M-^\spoken like a$
true little lady.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
In some respects he was wholly undisciplined, and had never learnt the$
necessity of refraining from answering back. And the woman irritated$
him, and irritation was a novel sensation.$
$
Her face was dark with rage, but it was upon Sir John, descending in$
haste to meet his offended wife, that she turned the full batteries of$
her anger.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know the time, of course. Your watch has stopped. It is hard$
enough for me to keep my end up without you helping to make me look$
foolish!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My dear,M-bM-^@M-^] protested Maxell in a flurry, M-bM-^@M-^\I assure youM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You can spend your time with this sort of trash,M-bM-^@M-^] she indicated$
Timothy, and Timothy bowed, M-bM-^@M-^\but you keep me waiting like a tailorM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
model at SothebyM-bM-^@M-^Ys, of all people in the world, when you know well$
enoughM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My dear,M-bM-^@M-^] pleaded the lawyer wearily, M-bM-^@M-^\my watch has certainly$
stoppedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ah! You make me tired. What are you doing with this fellow? Do you$
think I want reminding of movie days? Everybody knows this fellowM-bM-^@M-^Ta$
cheap gambler, whoM-bM-^@M-^Ys been fired out of every studio in England. You$
allow your servants to insult meM-bM-^@M-^Tand now I suppose youM-bM-^@M-^Yve brought this$
prize-fighter to keep me in my place,M-bM-^@M-^] and she pointed scornfully at the$
amused Timothy.$
$
Half-way downstairs the girl stood watching the scene in silence, and it$
was only when he became conscious of her presence that Timothy began to$
feel a little uncomfortable.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, good-bye, Sir John,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sorry I intruded.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wait,M-bM-^@M-^] said the woman. M-bM-^@M-^\John, this man has insulted me! I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know$
what heM-bM-^@M-^Ys come for, but I suppose he wants something. HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys one of those$
shifty fellows that hang around studios begging for money to bet with.$
If you raise a hand to help him, why, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym finished with you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I assure you,M-bM-^@M-^] said Sir John in his most pompous manner, M-bM-^@M-^\that this$
young man has asked for nothing more than a letter of introduction. I$
have a dutyM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Stop!M-bM-^@M-^] said the woman. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve a duty to me, too. Hold fast to your$
money. Likely as not, youM-bM-^@M-^Yll do neither with M-bM-^@M-^XTake A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^Y Anderson$
floating around.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was not her words, neither the contempt in her voice nor the insult$
which stung him. The man who went twenty rounds with Kid Muldoon had$
learnt to control his temper, but there was a new factor presentM-bM-^@M-^Ta$
factor who wore a plain grey dress, and had two big, black eyes which$
were now solemnly surveying him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Lady Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\it is pretty difficult to give the lie to any$
woman, but I tell you that what you say now is utterly false. I had no$
intention when I came to Bournemouth of asking for anything that would$
cost Sir John a penny. As to my past, I suppose it has been a little$
eccentric, but it is clean, Lady Maxell.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He meant no more than he said. He had no knowledge of Sadie OM-bM-^@M-^YGradyM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
antecedents, or he might not have emphasised the purity of his own. But$
the woman went back as though she had been whipped, and Timothy had a$
momentary vision of a charging fury, before she flung herself upon him,$
tearing at his face, shrieking aloud in her rage. . .$
$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\Phew!M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
He took off his hat and fanned himself. It was the first time he had$
ever run away from trouble, but now he had almost flown. Those favoured$
people who were in sight of Sir John MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys handsome villa, saw the$
door swung open and a young man taking the front path in four strides$
and the gate in another before he sped like the wind along the street.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Phew!M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy again.$
$
He went the longest way back to his hotel, to find that a telephone$
message had been received from Sir John. It was short and to the point.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Please donM-bM-^@M-^Yt come again.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy read the slip and chuckled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is it likely?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked the page who brought the message.$
$
Then he remembered the girl in grey, with the dark eyes, and he fingered$
his smooth chin thoughtfully.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wonder if it is worth while taking a chance,M-bM-^@M-^] he said to himself, and$
decided that, for the moment, it was not.$

                               CHAPTER X$
$
$
LADY MAXELL yawned and put down the magazine she was reading. She$
looked at her watch. It was ten oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock. At such an hour Paris would be$
beginning to wake up. The best people would still be in the midst of$
their dinner, and Marie de Montdidier (born Hopkins) would be putting$
the final dabs of powder on her nose in her dressing-room at the Folies$
BergM-CM-(res before making her first and her final appearance.$
$
The boulevards would be bright with light, and there would be lines of$
twinkling autos in the Bois for the late diners at the Aromonville. She$
looked across at the girl sitting under a big lamp in a window recess, a$
book on her knees, but her mind and eyes elsewhere.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, and the girl, with a start, woke from her reverie.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you want me, Lady Maxell?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is the matter with Sir John? You know him better than I do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl shook her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I hardly know, Lady MaxellM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\For heavenM-bM-^@M-^Ys sake donM-bM-^@M-^Yt call me M-bM-^@M-^XLady Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] said the other$
irritably. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve told you to call me Sadie if you want to.M-bM-^@M-^] There was a$
silence. M-bM-^@M-^\Evidently you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want,M-bM-^@M-^] snapped the woman. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre what I$
call a fine, sociable family. You seem to get your manners from your new$
friend.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl went red.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My new friend?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked, and Lady Maxell turned her back to her with$
some resolution and resumed for a moment the reading of her magazine.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt mind if you find any pleasure in talking to that kind of$
insect,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, putting the periodical down again. M-bM-^@M-^\Why, the worldM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
full of those do-nothing boys. I suppose he knows thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys money coming$
to you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Very little, Lady Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A littleM-bM-^@M-^Ys a lot to a man like that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other. M-bM-^@M-^\You mustnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
think I am prejudiced because I wasM-bM-^@M-^TerM-bM-^@M-^Tannoyed the other day. That is$
temperament.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Again the girl smiled, but it was a different kind of smile, and Lady$
Maxell observed it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You can marry him as far as I am concerned,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\These sneaking$
meetings are not exactly complimentary to Sir John, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl closed her book, walked across to the shelf and put it away$
before she spoke.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I suppose youM-bM-^@M-^Yre speaking of Mr. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, I have met$
him, but there has been nothing furtive in the meetings. He stopped me$
in the park and apologised for having been responsible for the$
sceneM-bM-^@M-^Tfor your temperament, you know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Lady Maxell looked up sharply, but the girl met her eyes without$
wavering.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I hope you arenM-bM-^@M-^Yt trying to be sarcastic,M-bM-^@M-^] complained the older woman.$
M-bM-^@M-^\One never knows how deep you are. But I can tell you this, that sarcasm$
is wasted on me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sure of that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl.$
$
Lady Maxell looked again, but apparently the girl was innocent of$
offensive design.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I say I met Mr. Anderson. He was very polite and very nice. Then I met$
him againM-bM-^@M-^Tin fact, I have met him several times,M-bM-^@M-^] she said$
thoughtfully. M-bM-^@M-^\So far from his being a do-nothing, Lady Maxell, I think$
you are doing him an injustice. He is working at the Parade Drug Store.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He will make a fine match for you,M-bM-^@M-^] said the woman. M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John will just$
love having a shop-walker in the family!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
That ended the conversation for both of them, and they sat reading for a$
quarter of an hour before Lady Maxell threw her magazine on the floor$
and got up.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John had a telegram yesterday that worried him,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you$
know what it was about?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Honestly I do not know, Lady Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\Why donM-bM-^@M-^Yt you ask$
him yourself?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Because he would tell me a lie,M-bM-^@M-^] said the woman coolly, and the girl$
winced.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He brought all his money and securities from the Dawlish and County$
Bank to-day and put them in his safe and he had the chief constable with$
him for half an hour this morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This was news to the girl, and she was interested in spite of herself.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to be frank with$
youM-bM-^@M-^Tfrankness pays sometimes. They called my marriage a romance of the$
screen. Every newspaper said as much and I suppose that is true. But the$
most romantic part of the marriage was my estate in Honolulu, my big$
house in Paris and my bank balance. EllsbergerM-bM-^@M-^Ys publicity man put all$
that stuff about, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve an idea that Sir John was highly disappointed$
when he found heM-bM-^@M-^Yd married me for myself alone. ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys how it strikes$
me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Here was a marriage which had shocked Society and had upset the smooth$
current of the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys life, placed in an entirely new light.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ArenM-bM-^@M-^Yt you very rich?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked slowly, and Sadie laughed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Rich! There was a tram fare between me and the workhouse the day I$
married Sir John,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt blame him for being disappointed.$
Lots of these cinema stars are worth millionsM-bM-^@M-^TI wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt one of them. I$
married because I thought I was going to have a good timeM-bM-^@M-^Tlots of money$
and plenty of travelM-bM-^@M-^Tand I chose with my eyes shut.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl was silent. For once Sadie MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys complaint had$
justification. Sir John Maxell was not a spending man. He lived well,$
but never outside the circle of necessity.$
$
The girl was about to speak, when there came a dramatic interruption.$
$
There was a M-bM-^@M-^\whang!M-bM-^@M-^] a splintering of glass and something thudded$
against the wall. Lady Maxell stood up as white as death.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What was that?M-bM-^@M-^] she gasped.$
$
The girl was pale, but she did not lose her nerve.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Somebody fired a shot. Look!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She pulled aside the curtain. M-bM-^@M-^\The bullet went through the window.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Keep away from the window, you fool!M-bM-^@M-^] screamed the woman. M-bM-^@M-^\Turn out the$
light! Ring the bell!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mary moved across the room and turned the switch. They waited in$
silence, but no other shot was fired. Perhaps it was an accident.$
Somebody had been firing at a target. . . .$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Go and tell my husband!M-bM-^@M-^] said Sadie. M-bM-^@M-^\Quickly!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl passed through the lighted hall upstairs and knocked at Sir$
JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys door. There was no answer. She tried the door, but found it$
locked. This was not unusual. He had a separate entrance to his study,$
communicating by a balcony and a flight of stairs with the garden. A$
wild fear seized her. Possibly Sir John had been in the garden when the$
shot was fired; it may have been intended for him. She knocked again$
louder, and this time she heard his step and the door was opened.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Did you knock before?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked. M-bM-^@M-^\I was writingM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Then he saw her face.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What has happened?M-bM-^@M-^] he demanded.$
$
The girl told him, and he made his way downstairs slowly, as was his$
wont. He entered the drawing-room, switched on the lights, and without a$
glance at his wife walked to the window and examined the shattered pane.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I imagined I heard a noise, but thought somebody had dropped something.$
When did this happen? Just before you came up?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl nodded.$
$
Maxell looked from one to the other. His wife was almost speechless with$
terror, and Mary Maxell alone was calm.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It has come already,M-bM-^@M-^] he said musingly. M-bM-^@M-^\I did not think that this$
would happen so soon.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He walked down to the hall where the telephone hung and rang through to$
the police station, and the girl heard all he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, it is Sir John Maxell speaking. A shot has just been fired through$
my window. No, not at meM-bM-^@M-^TI was in my study. Apparently a rifle shot.$
Yes, I was rightM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Presently he came back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The police will be here in a few moments to make a search of the$
grounds,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but I doubt whether they will catch the miscreant.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is it possible that it was an accident?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Accident?M-bM-^@M-^] He smiled. M-bM-^@M-^\I think not,M-bM-^@M-^] he said dryly. M-bM-^@M-^\That kind of$
accident is liable to happen again. You had better come up to my study,$
both of you, till the police arrive,M-bM-^@M-^] he said and led the way up the$
stairs.$
$
He did not attempt to support his wife, though her nerve was obviously$
shaken. Possibly he did not observe this fact until they were in the$
room, for after a glance at her face he pushed a chair forward.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sit down,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
The study was the one room to which his wife was seldom admitted.$
Dominated as he was by her in other matters, he was firm on this point.$
It was perhaps something of a novelty for herM-bM-^@M-^Ta novelty which will$
still the whimper of the crying child has something of the same effect$
upon a nervous woman.$
$
The door of the safe was open and the big table was piled high with$
sealed packages. The only money she saw was a thick pad of bank-notes$
fastened about with a paper bandage, on which something was written. On$
this she fixed her eyes. She had never seen so much money in her life,$
and he must have noticed the attention this display of wealth had$
created, for he took up the money and slipped it into a large envelope.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This is your money, Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he beamed over his glasses at the girl.$
$
She was feeling the reaction of her experience now and was trembling in$
every limb. Yet she thought she recognised in this diversion an attempt$
on his part to soothe her, and she smiled and tried hard to respond.$
$
They had been daily companions since she was a mite of four, and between$
him and his dead brotherM-bM-^@M-^Ys child there was a whole lot of understanding$
and sympathy which other people never knew.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My money, uncle?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I realised your investments last week,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I happened to know$
that the Corporation in which the money stood had incurred very heavy$
losses through some error in insurance. It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a great deal, but I$
couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt afford to let you take any further risks.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There was, of course, a possibility of this shot having been fired by$
accident,M-bM-^@M-^] he went on, reverting to the matter which would naturally be$
at the back of his mind. Then he fell into thought, pacing the room in$
silence.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I thought you were out,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, stopping suddenly in front of the$
girl. M-bM-^@M-^\You told me you were going to a concert.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Before she could explain why she changed her mind they heard the sound$
of voices in the hall.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Stay here,M-bM-^@M-^] said Sir John. M-bM-^@M-^\It is the police. I will go down and tell$
them all there is to know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
When her husband had gone, Lady Maxell rose from her chair. The table,$
with its sealed packages, drew her like a magnet. She fingered them one$
by one, and came at last to the envelope containing MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys patrimony.$
This she lifted in her hands, weighing it. Then, with a deep sigh, she$
replaced the package on the table.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys money there,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, and Mary smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not a great deal, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid. Father was comparatively poor when he$
died.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys money,M-bM-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell thoughtfully; M-bM-^@M-^\more than I have ever$
seen since I have been in this house, believe me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She returned, as though fascinated, and lifted the envelope again and$
peered inside.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Poor, was he?M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\I think you people donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what poverty$
is. Do you know what all this means?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She held the envelope up and there was a look in her face which the girl$
had never seen before.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It means comfort, it means freedom from worry, it means that you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
have to pretend and make love to men whom you loathe.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl had risen and was staring at her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Lady Maxell!M-bM-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice. M-bM-^@M-^\WhyM-bM-^@M-^TwhyM-bM-^@M-^TI never think of$
money like that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why should you?M-bM-^@M-^] said the woman roughly, as she flung the package on$
the table. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been after money in quantities like that all my life.$
It has always been dangling in front of me and eluding meM-bM-^@M-^Teluding is$
the word, isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked carelessly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What are all those pictures?M-bM-^@M-^] she changed the subject abruptly,$
pointing to the framed photographs which covered the walls. M-bM-^@M-^\TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yre$
photographs of India, arenM-bM-^@M-^Yt they?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Morocco,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John was born in Morocco and lived there$
until he went to school. He speaks Arabic like a native. Did you know$
that?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Morocco,M-bM-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys strange. Morocco!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know it?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been thereM-bM-^@M-^Tonce,M-bM-^@M-^] replied the other shortly. M-bM-^@M-^\Did Sir John go$
often?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Before he married, yes,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mary. M-bM-^@M-^\He had large interests there at$
one time, I think.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sir John came back at that moment, and Mary noticed that his first$
glance was at the table.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, theyM-bM-^@M-^Yve found nothing,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\neither footprints nor the$
empty shell. TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yre making a search of the grounds to-morrow. Lebbitter$
wanted to post a man to protect the house in view of the other matter.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What other matter?M-bM-^@M-^] asked his wife quickly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is nothing,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\nothing really which concerns you. Of course,$
I would not allow the police to do that. It would make the house more$
conspicuous than it is at present.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He looked at the two.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now,M-bM-^@M-^] he said bluntly, M-bM-^@M-^\I think you had better go off to bed. I have$
still a lot of work to do.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
His wife obeyed without a word, and the girl was following her, when he$
called her back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, laying his hand upon her shoulder, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym afraid IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not$
the best man that ever lived, but IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tried to make you happy, my dear,$
in my own way. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve been as a daughter to me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked up at him with shining eyes. She could not trust herself to$
speak.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Things havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt gone as well as they might during the past year,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said. M-bM-^@M-^\I made a colossal blunder, but I made it with my eyes open. It$
hasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt been pleasant for either of us, but thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no sense in$
regretting what you cannot mend. Mary, they tell me that youM-bM-^@M-^Yve been$
seeing a lot of this young man Anderson?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was annoyed to find herself going red when there was really no$
reason for it. She need not ask who M-bM-^@M-^\theyM-bM-^@M-^] were, she could guess.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been making inquiries about that boy,M-bM-^@M-^] said Sir John slowly, M-bM-^@M-^\and$
I can tell you this, he is straight. Perhaps he has led an$
unconventional life, but all that he told Sadie was true. HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys clean,$
and, Mary, that counts for something in this world.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He seemed at a loss how to proceed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Anything might happen,M-bM-^@M-^] he went on. M-bM-^@M-^\Although IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not an old man, I$
have enemies. . . .M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt meanM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have many enemies,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Some of them are hateful, and I want to$
tell you this, that if trouble ever comes and that boy is within$
callM-bM-^@M-^Tgo to him. I know men, good, bad and indifferent; heM-bM-^@M-^Ys neither bad$
nor indifferent. And now, good night!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He kissed her on the forehead.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You neednM-bM-^@M-^Yt tell your aunt what IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been talking about,M-bM-^@M-^] he said at$
parting and led her to the door, closing and locking it behind her.$
$
He sat down in his chair for a very long time before he made a move,$
then he began picking up the packages and carrying them to the safe. He$
stopped half-way through and resumed his seat in the chair, waiting for$
the hour to pass, by which time he judged the household would be asleep.$
$
At midnight he took a pair of rubber boots from a locker, pulled them$
on, and went out through the door leading to the balcony, down the$
covered stairway to the garden. Unerringly he walked across the lawn to$
a corner of his grounds which his gardeners had never attempted to$
cultivate. He stopped once and groped about in the bushes for a spade$
which he had carefully planted there a few nights before. His hand$
touched the rotting wood of an older spade and he smiled. For six years$
the tool had remained where he had put it the last time he had visited$
this No-ManM-bM-^@M-^Ys-Land.$
$
Presently he came to a little hillock and began digging. The soil was$
soft, and he had not gone far before the spade struck wood. He cleared a$
space two feet square and drew from the earth a small crescent of wood.$
It was, in fact, a part of the wooden cover of a well which had long$
since gone dry but which had been covered up by its previous owner and$
again covered by Maxell.$
$
Lying at full length on the ground, he reached down through the$
aperture, and his fingers found a big rusty nail on which was suspended$
a length of piano wire. At the end of the wire was attached a small$
leather bag and this he drew up and unfastened, and putting the bag on$
one side, let the free end of the wire fall into the well.$
$
He replaced the wood, covered it again with earth, all the time$
exercising care, for, small as the aperture was, it was big enough for$
even a man of his size to slip through.$
$
A cloaked figure which stood in the shadow of the bushes watching him,$
which had followed him as noiselessly across the lawn, saw him lift the$
bag and take it back to the house and disappear through the covered$
stairway. So still a night it was, that the watcher could hear the click$
of the lower door as Sir John locked it, and the soft pad of his feet as$
they mounted the stairs.$

                               CHAPTER XI$
$
$
MR. GOLDBERG, the manager and proprietor of the Parade Drug Store, was$
a man who possessed neither a sense of imagination nor the spirit of$
romance. He sent peremptorily for Timothy, and Timothy came with a$
feeling that all was not well.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] said Goldberg in his best magisterial manner, M-bM-^@M-^\I took$
you into my shop because I was short of a man and because I understood$
that you had had some business experience.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have business experience,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy carefully, M-bM-^@M-^\of a kind.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I gave you particular instructions,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg solemnly, M-bM-^@M-^\on$
one very vital point. We carry a full line of all the best proprietorial$
medicines, and our customers can always get them upon application. Each$
of those medicines we duplicate, as you know, providing the same$
constituents and charging some sixpence to a shilling lessM-bM-^@M-^Tin fact, we$
are out to save the public from being robbed.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I understand you,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\but I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt see much difference$
between robbing the public and robbing the patent medicine proprietors,$
and all that just-as-good stuff never did impress me, anyway. It stands$
to reason,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, leaning over the desk and speaking with the$
earnestness of a crusader, M-bM-^@M-^\that the advertised article must be more$
even in quality and it must be good all round. You canM-bM-^@M-^Yt advertise a bad$
article and get away with it, except on the first sale, and that doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
pay the advertiser. The goods sell the goods, and the advertisement is$
only to make you take the first lick.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I do not want a lecture on advertising or on commercial morality,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Mr. Goldberg with ominous calm. M-bM-^@M-^\I merely want to tell you that you were$
overheard by my chief assistant telling a customer not to M-bM-^@M-^Xtake a$
chanceM-bM-^@M-^Y on one of my own pills.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys right,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, nodding his head vigorously. M-bM-^@M-^\Guilty, my$
lord. What about it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have had a further complaint,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr. Goldberg, consulting with$
elaborate ceremony a little notebook. M-bM-^@M-^\I understand that you have$
initiated the awful practice of offering to toss customers for their$
change. People have written me strong letters of complaint about it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Because they lost,M-bM-^@M-^] said the indignant Timothy; M-bM-^@M-^\whatM-bM-^@M-^Ys wrong about$
that, anyway, Mr. Goldberg? I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt pocket the money, and I win twice$
out of every three times. If a fellow likes to take a chance as to$
whether he gets sixpence or we get a shilling, why worry?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The outraged Mr. Goldberg brindled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That sort of thing may be all right at a country fair or even in a$
country shop,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but it is not good enough for the Parade Drug$
Store, Bournemouth, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yll dispense with your services as from this$
morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre losing a good man,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, but Mr. Goldberg did$
not seem to take that loss to heart.$
$
All M-bM-^@M-^\Take A Chance AndersonM-bM-^@M-^YsM-bM-^@M-^] jobs ended violently. He never conceived$
of them ending in any other way, and invariably regarded the sum of$
money which was received in lieu of notice, or as compensation for$
breach of contract, as being something in the nature of a nest-egg which$
a kindly Providence had foreordained, and he was neither cast down nor$
elated by the crisis in his affairs when, by a fortunate accident, he$
met Mary MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Tthe fortune was apparent, but the accident belonged to$
the category which determined the hour at which trains leave stations.$
$
Hitherto, on the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys part, these meetings had been fraught with a$
certain amount of apprehension, if not terror. They had begun when$
Timothy had stopped her on the morning after his quarrel with Lady$
Maxell, and had made bland inquiries as to that ladyM-bM-^@M-^Ys condition. Then$
she had been in a panic and frantically anxious to end the interview,$
and it required all her self-restraint to prevent her flying at top$
speed from this wicked young man who had been so abominably rude.$
$
At their second meeting he had greeted her as an old friend, and she had$
left him with the illusion of a life-time acquaintance. Hereafter$
matters went smoothly, and they went so because Timothy Anderson was$
unlike any of the other boys she had ever met.$
$
He paid her no compliments, he did not grow sentimental, he neither$
tried to hold her hand nor kiss her, nor was he ever oppressed by that$
overwhelming melancholy which is the heritage and pride of youth.$
$
Not once did he hint at an early decline or the possibility of his going$
away to die in far lands. Instead he kept her in screams of laughter at$
his interpretation of movie plays in the making. He did not ask for a$
keepsake; the only request he made of her in this direction was one$
which first took her breath away. Thereafter she never met him unless$
she had in the bag which slung from her wrist one small box of matches;$
for M-bM-^@M-^\Take A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^] Anderson had never possessed or carried the means of$
ignition for his cigarette for one whole hour together.$
$
Timothy told her most of what the proprietor of the Parade Drug Store$
had told him. The girl thought it was a joke, because that was exactly$
the way Timothy presented the matter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But you wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt be going away soon?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not till I go abroad,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Timothy calmly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are you going abroad too?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked in surprise.$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to Paris and Monte CarloM-bM-^@M-^Tespecially to Monte Carlo,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said, M-bM-^@M-^\and afterwards I may run across to Algeria or to Egypt.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked at him with a new respect. She was less impressed by the$
great possessions which his plans betrayed than by his confident$
independence, and dimly she wondered why he was working at a drug-store$
for low wages and wondered, too, whether he wasM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What are you blushing about?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy curiously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt blushing,M-bM-^@M-^] she protested; M-bM-^@M-^\I was just wondering whether I$
could ever afford a trip like that.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course you can,M-bM-^@M-^] said the young man scornfully. M-bM-^@M-^\If I can afford it,$
you can, canM-bM-^@M-^Yt you? If I go abroad and stay at the best hotels, and go$
joy rides in the Alps and plan all this when I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt got fifteen$
shillings over my rentM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt fifteen shillings over your rent!M-bM-^@M-^] she repeated, aghast.$
M-bM-^@M-^\But how can you go abroad without money?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy was genuinely astounded that she could ask so absurd a question.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, IM-bM-^@M-^Yd take a chance on that,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\A little thing like money$
doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt really count.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think youM-bM-^@M-^Yre very silly,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, there was something I wanted$
to tell you, Mr. Anderson.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You may call me Timothy,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want to call you Timothy,M-bM-^@M-^] she replied.$
$
He shook his head with a pained expression.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ItM-bM-^@M-^Yll be ever so much more sociable if you call me Timothy and I call$
you Mary.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We can be very sociable without that familiarity,M-bM-^@M-^] she said severely.$
M-bM-^@M-^\I was just going to tell you something.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They sat on the grass together, on the shadow fringe of a big oak and$
the spring sunshine wove its restless arabesques on her lap.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know,M-bM-^@M-^] she said after a pause, M-bM-^@M-^\that last night I had two queer$
experiences and I was scared; oh, scared to death!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Eating things at night,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy oracularly, M-bM-^@M-^\especially before$
you go to bedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt dreaming,M-bM-^@M-^] she said indignantly, M-bM-^@M-^\nor was it a nightmare. I$
wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt tell you if youM-bM-^@M-^Yre so horrid.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym only speaking as an ex-chemist and druggist,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy gravely;$
M-bM-^@M-^\but please forgive me. Tell me what it is, Mary.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss Mary Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] he compromised.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\First IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell you the least worst,M-bM-^@M-^] she began. M-bM-^@M-^\It happened about one$
oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock in the morning. I had gone to bed awfully tired, but somehow I$
couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt sleep, so I got up and walked about the room. I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt like$
putting on the light because that meant drawing down the blinds which I$
had let up when I went to bed, and the blinds make such a noise that I$
thought the whole of the house would hear. So I put on my dressing-gown$
and sat by the window. It was rather chilly, but my wrap was warm, and$
sitting there I dozed. I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know how long, but it was nearly an hour,$
I think. When I woke up I saw a man right in the centre of the lawn.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy was interested.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What sort of a man?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is the peculiar thing about it,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\He wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a white$
man.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A coon?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
She shook her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, I think it must have been a Moor. He wore a long white dress that$
reached down to his ankles, and over that he had a big, heavy black$
cloak.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He went round the corner of the house towards uncleM-bM-^@M-^Ys private stairway$
and he was gone quite a long time. My first thought was to awaken uncle$
and tell him, but then I remembered that Sir John had spent a long time$
in Morocco and possibly he knew that the man was about the house. You$
see, we have had Moorish visitors before, when ships have come to Poole.$
Once we had a very important man, a Kaid, and Sir John made queer tea$
for him in glasses with mint and stuff. So I just didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what to$
do. Whilst I was wondering whether I ought not at least to wake Lady$
Maxell, he reappeared, walked across the lawn and went down the path$
which leads to the back entranceM-bM-^@M-^TyouM-bM-^@M-^Yre laughing at me,M-bM-^@M-^] she said$
suddenly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What you mistake for a laugh,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy solemnly, M-bM-^@M-^\is merely one$
large smile of pleasure at being in your confidence.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was in two minds as to whether she would be angry or pleased, but$
his tone changed to a more serious one.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt like the idea of the gaudy East wandering loose under your$
bedroom window in the middle of the night,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Did you tell Lady$
Maxell this morning?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl shook her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, she was up very early and has been out all day. I have not seen$
herM-bM-^@M-^Tin fact, she was not at breakfast. Now IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell you the really$
serious thing that happened, and I do hope, Mr. Anderson, that you wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
be flippant.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Trust me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
The girl had no reason to complain of his attitude when she had$
described the shooting incident. He was aghast.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is terrible!M-bM-^@M-^] he said vigorously. M-bM-^@M-^\Why, it might have hit you!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course it might have hit me,M-bM-^@M-^] she said indignantly. M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the$
whole point of my story, so far as you are concernedM-bM-^@M-^TI mean, so far as$
I am concerned,M-bM-^@M-^] she added hastily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So fax as I am concerned too,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy quietly. M-bM-^@M-^\I just hate the$
idea of anything even frightening you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She rose hurriedly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I am going to shop now,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the hurry?M-bM-^@M-^] grumbled Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, ignoring his question, M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want you to$
think that uncle is feeling badly about you because of what has happened$
in the house. He spoke to me of you last night, and he spoke very$
nicely. I am worried to death about Sir John. He has made enemies in his$
life, and I am sure that this shooting affair is the sequel to some old$
feud.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I should say that is so,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
He looked down at the grass very thoughtfully and then:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go home,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I had better sleep this afternoon if I$
am to be up all night.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Up all night?M-bM-^@M-^] she said in surprise. M-bM-^@M-^\What is happening? Is there a$
ball or something?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There will be something livelier than a ball,M-bM-^@M-^] he said grimly, M-bM-^@M-^\if I$
find anybody in your garden to-night. And Miss Maxell, if you look out$
of your window and you see a solitary figure on sentry-go donM-bM-^@M-^Yt shoot,$
because it will be me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But you mustnM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] she gasped. M-bM-^@M-^\Please donM-bM-^@M-^Yt do it, Mr. Anderson. Uncle$
would beM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He stopped her with a gesture.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Possibly nobody will come to-night,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and as likely as not I$
shall be pinched by the police as a suspicious character. But thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a$
chance that somebody will come, and thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys the chance IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to$
take.M-bM-^@M-^]$

$
                              CHAPTER XII$
$
$
TRUE to his word, he returned to his lodgings and spent the afternoon$
in slumber. He had the gift which all great men possess, of being able$
to sleep at will. He was staying at a boarding-house, and occupied a$
room which had originally been a side veranda, but had been walled in$
and converted into an extra bedroom. It was a remarkably convenient room$
for him, as he had discovered on previous occasions. He had but to open$
the window and drop on to the grass to make his exit without anybody in$
the house being the wiser. More to the point, he could return at any$
hour by the same route without disturbing the household.$
$
He had his supper, and whilst it was still very light he went out to$
reconnoitre Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys demesne. He was able to make the circuit of the$
house, which occupied a corner site and was isolated by two lanes, and$
he saw nobody until, returning to the front of the house, a car drove up$
and a woman alighted.$
$
He had no difficulty in recognising Lady Maxell, but the taxi interested$
him more than the lady. It was smothered with mud and had evidently come$
a long journey.$
$
As evidently she had hired it in some distant town and she had not as$
yet finished with it, because she gave the man some directions and$
money, and from the profound respect which the chauffeur showed, it was$
clear that that money was merely a tip.$
$
Timothy stood where he could clearly be seen, but her back was toward$
him all the time and she did not so much as glance in his direction when$
she passed through the gate and up the garden path.$
$
It was curious, thought Timothy, that she did not take the car up the$
drive to the house. More curious was it that she should, at this late$
hour of the evening, have further use for it.$
$
He returned to his room, full of theories, the majority of which were$
wholly wild and improbable. He lay on his bed, indulging in those dreams$
which made up the happiest part of his life. Of late he had taken a new$
and a more radiant pattern to the web of his fancy andM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, fiddlesticks!M-bM-^@M-^] he said in disgust, rolling over and sitting up with$
a yawn.$
$
He heard the feet of the boarders on the gravel path outside, and once$
he heard a girl say evidently to a visitor:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you see that funny room! That is Mr. AndersonM-bM-^@M-^Ys.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
There was still an hour or so to be passed, and he joined the party in$
the parlour so restless and distrait as to attract attention and a$
little mild raillery from his fellow guests. He went back to his room,$
turned on the light and pulled a trunk from under the bed.$
$
Somehow his mind had been running all day upon that erring cousin whose$
name he bore and whose disappearance from public life was such a$
mystery. Possibly it was Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys words which had brought Alfred$
Cartwright to his mind. His mother had left him a number of family$
documents, which, with the indolence of youth, he had never examined$
very closely. He had the impression that they consisted in the main of$
receipts, old diplomas of his fatherM-bM-^@M-^Ys (who was an engineer) and sundry$
other family documents which were not calculated to excite the curiosity$
of the adventurous youth.$
$
He took out the two big envelopes in which these papers were kept and$
turned them on to the bed, examining them one by one. Why his cousin$
should be in his mind, why he should have taken this action at that$
particular moment, the psychologist and the psychical expert alone can$
explain. They may produce in explanation such esoteric phenomena as$
auras, influences, and telepathies, and perhaps they are right.$
$
He had not searched long before he came upon a small package of$
newspaper cuttings, bound about by a rubber band. He read them at first$
without interest, and then without comprehension. There was one cutting,$
however, which had been clipped from its context, which seemed to tell$
the whole story of the rest. It ran:$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\When Cartwright stood up for sentence he did not seem to be$
    greatly troubled by his serious position. As the words M-bM-^@M-^Xtwenty$
    yearsM-bM-^@M-^Y passed Mr. Justice MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys lips, he fell back as if he$
    had been shot. Then, springing to the edge of the dock, he$
    hurled an epithet at his lordship. Some of his business$
    associates suggest that the learned judge was a partner of$
    CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^YsM-bM-^@M-^Tan astonishing and most improper suggestion to$
    make. In view of the statement that the prisoner made before the$
    trial, when suggestions had been made in a newspaper that the$
    judge had been connected with him in business years before, and$
    remembering that CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys statement was to the effect that$
    he had had no business transactions with the judge, it seems as$
    though the outburst was made in a fit of spleen at the severity$
    of the sentence. Sir John Maxell, after the case, took the$
    unusual step of informing a Press representative that he$
    intended placing his affairs in the hands of a committee for$
    investigation, and had invited the Attorney-General to appoint$
    that committee. M-bM-^@M-^XI insist upon this being done,M-bM-^@M-^Y he said,$
    M-bM-^@M-^Xbecause after the prisonerM-bM-^@M-^Ys accusation I should not feel$
    comfortable until an impartial committee had examined my$
    affairs.M-bM-^@M-^Y It is understood that after the investigation the$
    learned judge intends retiring from the Bench.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy gasped. So that was the explanation. That was why Maxell had$
written to him, that was why he made no reference at all to his father,$
but to this disreputable cousin of his. Slowly he returned the package$
to its envelope, dropped it into his trunk and pushed the trunk under$
the bed.$
$
And that was the secret of Cousin CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys disappearance. He might$
have guessed it; he might even have known had he troubled to look at$
these papers.$
$
He sat on the bed, his hands clasping his knees. It was not a pleasant$
reflection that he had a relative, and a relative moreover after whom he$
was named, serving what might be a life sentence in a convict$
establishment. But what made him think of the matter to-night?$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson! Timothy!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy looked round with a start. The man whose face was framed in the$
open window might have been forty, fifty or sixty. It was a face heavily$
seamed and sparsely beardedM-bM-^@M-^Ta hollow-eyed, hungry face, but those eyes$
burnt like fire. Timothy jumped up.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hullo!M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Who are you M-bM-^@M-^XTimothyingM-bM-^@M-^Y?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?M-bM-^@M-^] the man laughed unpleasantly. M-bM-^@M-^\Can I come in?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, you can come in,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
He wondered what old acquaintance this was who had come to the tramp$
level, and rapidly turned over in his mind all the possible candidates$
for trampdom he had met.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know me, eh?M-bM-^@M-^] said the man again. M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve tracked you$
here, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been sitting in those bushes for two hours. I heard one$
of the boarders say that it was your window and I waited till it was$
dark before I came out.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\All this is highly interesting,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, surveying the shrunken$
figure without enthusiasm, M-bM-^@M-^\but who are you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I had a provisional pardon,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man, M-bM-^@M-^\and they put me in a$
sanatoriumM-bM-^@M-^TIM-bM-^@M-^Yve something the matter with one of my lungs. It was$
always a trouble to me. I was supposed to stay in the sanatoriumM-bM-^@M-^Tthat$
was one of the terms on which I was pardonedM-bM-^@M-^Tbut I escaped.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy stared at him with open mouth.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Alfred Cartwright!M-bM-^@M-^] he breathed.$
$
The man nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys me,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
Timothy looked down at the edge of the black box.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So that is why I was thinking about you,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\Well, this beats$
all! Sit down, wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He pulled a chair up for his visitor and again gazed on him with$
curiosity but without affection. Something in TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys attitude annoyed$
Cartwright.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre not glad to see me?M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not very,M-bM-^@M-^] admitted Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\The truth is, youM-bM-^@M-^Yve only just come into$
existence so far as I am concerned. I thought you were dead.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt know?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not until a few minutes ago. I was reading the cuttings about your$
trialM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So that was what you were reading?M-bM-^@M-^] said the man. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yd like to see M-bM-^@M-^Yem$
one of these days. Do you know what IM-bM-^@M-^Yve come for?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was only at that moment that Sir John flashed through TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys mind.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I guess what youM-bM-^@M-^Yve come after,M-bM-^@M-^] he said slowly. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre here to see$
Sir John Maxell.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym here to see Mister Justice Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man between his teeth.$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a good guesser.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He took the stump of a cigar from his waistcoat pocket and lit it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\John Maxell and I have a score to settle, and it is going to be settled$
very soon.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Tide and weather permitting,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy flippantly, recovering his$
self-possession. M-bM-^@M-^\All that vendetta stuff doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt go, Mr. Cartwright.M-bM-^@M-^]$
Then he asked in a flash: M-bM-^@M-^\Did you shoot at him last night?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The manM-bM-^@M-^Ys surprise was a convincing reply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shoot at him? I only got to this place this afternoon. ItM-bM-^@M-^Ys more likely$
heM-bM-^@M-^Ys waiting to shoot at me, for the sanatorium people will have$
telegraphed to him the moment I was missing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy walked to the window and pulled down the blinds.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now tell me, Mr. Cartwright, before we go any farther, do you still$
persist in the story you told the court, that the judge was a party to$
your swindle?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A party to it!M-bM-^@M-^] said the other man furiously. M-bM-^@M-^\Of course he was! I was$
using the money of my companies to buy concessions from the Moorish$
Government, as much on his behalf as on mine. He wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt in the Brigot$
swindleM-bM-^@M-^Tbut he held shares in the company I was financing. We located a$
gold mine in the Angera country, and Maxell and I went across to Europe$
every year regularly to look after our property.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We had to keep it quiet because we secured the concessions from the$
Pretender, knowing that heM-bM-^@M-^Yd put the Sultan out of business the moment$
he got busy. If it had been known, the Sultan would have repudiated the$
concession, and our Government would have upheld the repudiation. Maxell$
speaks the language like a native, and I learnt enough to get on with El$
Mograb, who is the biggest thing amongst the rebel tribes. El Mograb$
wanted us to stay there, Maxell and I; heM-bM-^@M-^Yd have made us shereefs or$
pashas, and IM-bM-^@M-^Yd have done it, because I knew there was going to be an$
investigation sooner or later into the affairs of my companies. But$
Maxell wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt have it. He always pretended that, so far as he knew, my$
financing was straight. You know the rest,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\When I came before$
Maxell, I thought I was safe.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But Sir John allowed his affairs to be inspected,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\If he$
had been engaged with you in this Morocco business, there must have been$
papers to prove it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright laughed harshly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course heM-bM-^@M-^Yd allow his affairs to be investigated,M-bM-^@M-^] he sneered. M-bM-^@M-^\Do$
you think that old fox couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt _cache_ all the documents that put him$
wrong? Papers? Why, he must have enough papers to hang him, if you could$
only find M-bM-^@M-^Yem!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What are you going to do?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
There was one thing he was determined that this man should _not_ do, and$
that was to disturb the peace of mind, not of Sir John Maxell or his$
wife, but of a certain goddess whose bedroom overlooked the lawn.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What am I going to do?M-bM-^@M-^] replied Cartwright. M-bM-^@M-^\Why, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going up to get$
my share. And heM-bM-^@M-^Yll be lucky if thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all he loses. One of the mines$
was sold to a syndicate last yearM-bM-^@M-^TI had news of it in gaol. He didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
get much for it because he was in a hurry to sellM-bM-^@M-^TI suppose his other$
investments must have been going wrong twelve months agoM-bM-^@M-^Tbut I want my$
share of that!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then you had best see Sir John in the morning. I will arrange an$
interview.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In the morning!M-bM-^@M-^] said the other contemptuously. M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose you make the$
arrangement, what would happen? When I went up there I should find a$
couple of cops waiting to pinch me. I know John! IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to see him$
to-night.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think not,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, and the man stared at him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You think not?M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\What has it to do with you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Quite a lot,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I merely state that you will not see him$
to-night.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Cartwright stroked his bristly chin undecidedly and then:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, well,M-bM-^@M-^] he said in a milder tone, M-bM-^@M-^\maybe you can fix things up for$
me in the morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where are you sleeping to-night?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Have you any money?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He had money, a little; and he had arranged to sleep at the house of a$
man he had known in better times. Timothy accompanied him through the$
window and into the street, and walked with him to the end of the road.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If my gamble had come off, youM-bM-^@M-^Yd have benefited, Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] said the$
man unexpectedly, breaking in upon another topic which they were$
discussing.$
$
They parted, and Timothy watched him out of sight, then turned on and$
walked in the opposite direction, to take up his self-imposed vigil.$
$

                              CHAPTER XIII$
$
$
THERE was something in the air that was electrical, and Mary Maxell$
felt it as she sat at supper with Sir John and his wife. Maxell was$
unusually silent and his wife amazingly so. She was nervous and almost$
jumped when a remark was addressed to her. The old truculence which$
distinguished her every word and action, her readiness to take offence,$
to see a slight in the most innocent remark, and her combativeness$
generally, had disappeared; she was almost meek when she replied to her$
husbandM-bM-^@M-^Ys questions.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I just went round shopping and then decided to call on a girl I had$
known a long time ago. She lives in the country, and I felt so nervous$
and depressed this morning that I thought a ride in a taxi would do me$
good.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt you take our car?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the other.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt decide until the last moment to go out to her, and then I went$
by train one way.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Sir John nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym glad you went into the fresh air,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\it will do you good.$
The country is not so beautiful as Honolulu, but it is not without its$
attractions.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was unusual for the Judge to be sarcastic, but it was less usual for$
Lady Maxell to accept sarcasm without a retort. To MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys surprise she$
made no reply, though a faint smile curved those straight lips of hers$
for a second.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you think it was a burglar last night?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked suddenly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Good heavens, no!M-bM-^@M-^] said Maxell. M-bM-^@M-^\Burglars do not shoot up the house$
they burgle.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you think it is safe to have all this money in the house?M-bM-^@M-^] she$
asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Perfectly safe,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I do not think that need alarm you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
No further reference was made to the matter, and presently Sir John went$
up to his study. Mrs. Maxell did not go to the parlour, but drew a chair$
to the fire in the dining-room and read, and the girl followed her$
example. Presently the elder woman left the room and was gone a quarter$
of an hour before she returned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, so sweetly that the girl was startled, M-bM-^@M-^\such an$
annoying thing has happenedM-bM-^@M-^TI have lost the key of my wardrobe. You$
borrowed one of Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys duplicates the other dayM-bM-^@M-^Twhere did you put$
the ring?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
John Maxell was a methodical and systematic man. He had a duplicate set$
of all the keys in the house, and these as a rule were kept in a small$
wall-safe in his own bedroom. He had never invited his wife to use that$
receptacle, but she had a shrewd idea that the combination which was$
denied to her had been given to the girl.$
$
Mary hesitated.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you think if you asked UncleM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My dear,M-bM-^@M-^] smiled the lady, M-bM-^@M-^\if I went to him now, heM-bM-^@M-^Yd never forgive$
me. If you know where the keys are, be an angel and get them for me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl rose, and Lady Maxell followed her upstairs. Her own room was$
next to her husbandM-bM-^@M-^Ys and communicated, but the door was invariably$
locked on MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys side. Presently the girl came in to her.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here they are,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Please let me put them back quickly. I feel$
very guilty at having taken them at all without his permission.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And for goodnessM-bM-^@M-^Y sake donM-bM-^@M-^Yt tell him,M-bM-^@M-^] said Lady Maxell, examining the$
keys.$
$
At last she found the one she wanted, but was a long time in the$
process. She opened her bureau and the girl took the big key-ring from$
her hand with such evident relief that Lady Maxell laughed.$
$
It had been easier than she thought and unless she made a blunder, the$
key she had selected from the bunch while she was fumbling at the$
bureau, would make just the differenceM-bM-^@M-^Tjust the difference.$
$
It was not customary for Sir John to come down from his study to enjoy$
the ladiesM-bM-^@M-^Y company after dinner, but on this evening he made an$
exception to his rule. He found his wife and ward reading, one on each$
side of the fireplace. Lady Maxell looked up when her husband came in.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here is a curious story, John,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\I think it must be an$
American story, about a woman who robbed her husband and the police$
refused to arrest her.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys nothing curious about that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the lawyer, M-bM-^@M-^\in law a wife$
cannot rob her husband or a husband his wife.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So that if you came to my Honolulu estate and stole my pearls,M-bM-^@M-^] she$
said banteringly, M-bM-^@M-^\I could not have you arrested.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Except for walking in my sleep!M-bM-^@M-^] he said smilingly, and they both$
laughed together.$
$
He had never seen her so amiable, and for the first time that dayM-bM-^@M-^Tit$
had been a very trying and momentous dayM-bM-^@M-^The had his misgivings. She,$
with the memory of her good dayM-bM-^@M-^Ys work, the excellent terms she had$
arranged with the skipper of the _Lord Lawrence_, due to leave$
Southampton for Cadiz at daylight the next morning, had no misgivings at$
all, especially when she thought of a key she had placed under her$
pillow. She had had the choice of two boats, the _Lord Lawrence_ and the$
_Saffi_, but the _SaffiM-bM-^@M-^Ys_ voyage would have been a long one, and its$
port of destination might hold discomfort which she had no wish to$
experience.$
$
The household retired at eleven oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock, and it was past midnight before$
Sadie Maxell heard her husbandM-bM-^@M-^Ys door close, and half an hour later$
before the click of the switch told her that his light had been$
extinguished.$
$
He was a ready sleeper, but she gave him yet another half-hour before$
she opened the door of her bedroom and stepped out into the black$
corridor. She moved noiselessly towards the study, her only fear being$
that the baronet had locked the door before he came out. But this fear$
was not well founded, and the door yielded readily to her touch. She was$
dressed, and carried only a small attachM-CM-) case filled with the bare$
necessities for the voyage.$
$
She pushed the catch of her electric lamp, located the safe and opened$
it with no difficulty. She found herself surprisingly short of breath,$
and her heart beat at such a furious rate that she thought it must be$
audible to everybody in the house. The envelope with the money lay at$
the bottom of the others, and she transferred its contents to her$
attachM-CM-) case in a few seconds.$
$
Then her heart stood still. . . .$
$
It was only the faintest creak she heard, but it came from a corner of$
the room where the door leading to the cupboard stairway was placed. She$
saw a faint grey line of light appearM-bM-^@M-^Tthe stairway had a glass roof and$
admitted enough light to show her that the door was slowly opening. She$
had to bite her lips to stop herself from screaming. To make her escape$
or to rouse Sir John was impossible, and she opened the attachM-CM-) case$
again, and with trembling fingers felt for the little revolver which she$
had taken from her drawer. She felt safer now, yet she had not the$
courage to switch on the light.$
$
She saw the figure of a man silhouetted in the opening, then the door$
closed, and her terror bred of itself a certain courage.$
$
She flashed the light full on his face. The dead silence was broken when$
she whispered:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, God! Benson!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhoM-bM-^@M-^Ys that?M-bM-^@M-^] he whispered, and snatched the torch from her hand.$
$
He looked at her long and curiously, and then:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I expected to find that Maxell had taken most of my possessions,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said, M-bM-^@M-^\but I never thought he would take my wife!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Let us see what all this is about,M-bM-^@M-^] boomed the big voice of John Maxell$
almost in the manM-bM-^@M-^Ys ear, he was so close, and suddenly the room was$
flooded with light.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER XIV$
$
$
THE self-appointed watcher found time pass very slowly. Twelve and one$
oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock struck from a distant church, but there was no sign of midnight$
assassins, and the house, looking very solemn and quiet in the light of$
a waning moon, irritated and annoyed him. From the roadway where he$
paced silently to and froM-bM-^@M-^The had taken the precaution of wearing a pair$
of rubber-soled shoesM-bM-^@M-^The could glimpse MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys window, and once he$
thought he saw her looking out.$
$
He made a point of walking entirely round the house twice in every hour,$
and it was on one of these excursions that he heard a sound which$
brought him to a standstill. It was a sound like two pieces of flat$
board being smacked together sharply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Tap . . . tap!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He stopped and listened, but heard nothing further. Then he retraced his$
footsteps to the front of the house and waited, but there was no sound$
or sign. Another half-hour passed, and then a patrolling policeman came$
along on the other side of the roadway. At the sight of the young man he$
crossed the road, and Jim recognised an acquaintance of his drug-store$
days. Nothing was to be gained by being evasive or mysterious, and$
Timothy told the policeman frankly his object.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I heard about the shooting last night,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man, M-bM-^@M-^\and the$
inspector offered to put one of our men on duty here, but Sir John$
wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt hear of it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He took a professional look at the house, and pointed to its dark upper$
windows.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That house is asleepM-bM-^@M-^Tyou neednM-bM-^@M-^Yt worry about that,M-bM-^@M-^] he said; M-bM-^@M-^\besides,$
itM-bM-^@M-^Yll be daylight in two hours, and a burglar wants that time to get$
home.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy paused irresolutely. It seemed absurd to wait any longer, and$
besides, to be consistent he must be prepared to adopt this watchman$
rM-CM-4le every night.$
$
There was no particular reason why Sir John MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys enemy should choose$
this night or any other. He had half expected to see Cartwright and was$
agreeably disappointed that he did not loom into view.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think youM-bM-^@M-^Yre right,M-bM-^@M-^] he said to the policeman. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll walk along down$
the road with you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
They must have walked a quarter of a mile, and were standing chatting at$
the corner of the street, when a sound, borne clearly on the night air,$
made both men look back in the direction whence they had come. They saw$
two glaring spots of light somewhere in the vicinity of the JudgeM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
house.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a car,M-bM-^@M-^] said the officer, M-bM-^@M-^\what is it doing there at this time$
of the morning? There is nobody sick in the house, is there?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy shook his head. Already he had begun to walk back, and the$
policeman, sensing something wrong, kept him company. They had covered$
half the distance which separated them from the car, when it began to$
move toward them, gathering speed. It flashed past and Timothy saw$
nothing save the driver, for the hood was raised and its canvas blinds$
hid whatever passenger it carried.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It came in from the other end of the avenue,M-bM-^@M-^] said the policeman$
unnecessarily. M-bM-^@M-^\Maybe Sir John is going a long journey and is starting$
early.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss Maxell would have told me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, troubled. M-bM-^@M-^\I nearly took$
a chance and made a jump for that car.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was one of the few chances Timothy did not take, and one that he$
bitterly regretted afterwards.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If you had,M-bM-^@M-^] said the practical policeman, M-bM-^@M-^\I should have been looking$
for the ambulance for you now.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy was no longer satisfied to play the rM-CM-4le of the silent watcher.$
When he came to the house he went boldly through the gate and up the$
drive, and his warrant for the intrusion was the officer who followed$
him. It was then that he saw the open window of the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys room, and his$
heart leapt into his mouth. He quickened his step, but just as he came$
under the window, she appeared, and Timothy sighed his relief.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is that you?M-bM-^@M-^] she said in a low worried voice; M-bM-^@M-^\is that Mr. Anderson?$
Thank heaven youM-bM-^@M-^Yve come! Wait, I will come down and open the door for$
you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He walked to the entrance, and presently the door was opened and the$
girl, dressed in a wrapper, appeared. She tried to keep her voice$
steady, but the strain of the past half-hour had been too much for her,$
and she was on the verge of tears when Timothy put his arm about her$
shaking shoulders and forced her down into a chair.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sit down,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and tell us what has happened.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked at the officer and tried to speak.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys a servant,M-bM-^@M-^] said the policeman; M-bM-^@M-^\perhaps he knows something.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
A man dressed in shirt and trousers was coming down the stairs.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I canM-bM-^@M-^Yt make him hear,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\or Lady Maxell, either.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What has happened?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know, sir. The young lady woke me and asked me to rouse Sir$
John.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Wait, wait,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\I am sorry I am so silly. I am probably$
making a lot of trouble over nothing. It happened nearly an hour ago, I$
was asleep and I heard a sound; thought I was dreaming of what happened$
last night. It sounded like two shots, but, whatever it was, it woke$
me.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know. I thought I heard them too,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then you were out there all the time?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked and put out her hand$
to him.$
$
For that look she gave him Timothy would have stayed out the three$
hundred and sixty-five nights in the year.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I lay for a very long time, thinking that the sound would wake my$
uncle, but I heard nothing.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is your room near Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the policeman.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, mine is on this side of the building; Sir John and Lady Maxell$
sleep on the other side. I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know what it was, but something alarmed$
me and filled me with terrorM-bM-^@M-^Tsomething that made my flesh go rough and$
coldM-bM-^@M-^Toh, it was horrible!M-bM-^@M-^] she shuddered.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt endure it any longer, so I got out of bed and went out into$
the corridor to wake uncle. Just then I heard a sound outside my window,$
but I was just too terrified to look out. Then I heard a motor-car and$
footsteps on the path outside. I went to Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys door and knocked,$
but got no answer. Then I tried Lady MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys door, but there was no$
answer there either. So I went to JohnsonM-bM-^@M-^Ys room and woke him;M-bM-^@M-^] she$
looked at Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^TIM-bM-^@M-^Tthought that you might be there, so I came$
back to the open window and looked.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Show me Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys room,M-bM-^@M-^] said the policeman to the servant, and the$
three men passed up the stairs, followed by the girl.$
$
The door which the man indicated was locked, and even when the policeman$
hammered on the panel there was no response.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think the key of my door will unlock almost any of the room doors,M-bM-^@M-^]$
said the girl suddenly. M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John told me once that all the room locks$
were made on the same plan.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She went away and came back with a key. The policeman fitted it in the$
lock and opened the door, feeling for and finding the electric switch as$
he entered. The room was empty, and apparently the bed had not been$
occupied.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where does that door lead?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That leads to Lady MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys room,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl; M-bM-^@M-^\there is a key on$
this side.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
This door he found was open and again they found an empty room and a bed$
which had not been slept in. They looked at one another.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt Sir John be in his study till late?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
The girl nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is at the end of the corridor,M-bM-^@M-^] she said in a broken voice, for she$
felt that the study held some dreadful secret.$
$
This door was locked too, locked from the inside. By now the policeman$
was standing on no ceremony, and with a quick thrust of his shoulder he$
broke the lock, and the door flew open.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Let us have a little light,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, unconsciously copying words which$
had been spoken in that room an hour before.$
$
The room was empty, but here at any rate was evidence. The safe stood$
open, the fireplace was filled with glowing ashes, and the air of the$
room was pungent with the scent of burnt paper.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is this?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy, pointing to the ground.$
$
The floor of the study was covered with a thick, biscuit-coloured$
carpet, and M-bM-^@M-^\thisM-bM-^@M-^] was a round, dark stain which was still wet. The$
policeman went on his knees and examined it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is blood,M-bM-^@M-^] he said briefly; M-bM-^@M-^\thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys another patch near the door.$
Where does this door lead? Catch that girl, sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys fainting!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy was just in time to slip his arm round MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys waist before she$
collapsed. By this time the household was aroused, and a woman servant$
was on the spot to take charge of Mary. When Timothy had rejoined the$
policeman, that officer had discovered where the door led.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You go down a stairway into the garden,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\It looks as if two$
shots were fired here. Look, thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys the mark of both of them on the$
wall.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you suggest that two people have been killed?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The policeman nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\One was shot in the middle of the room, and one was probably shot on$
the way to the door. What do you make of this?M-bM-^@M-^] and he held up a bag,$
discoloured and weather-worn, with a handle to which was fastened a long$
length of rusty wire.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is empty,M-bM-^@M-^] said the officer, examining the contents of the little$
grip which, up till an hour before, had held John MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys most$
jealously guarded secrets.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll use this M-bM-^@M-^Yphone,M-bM-^@M-^] said the officer. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yd better stay by, Mr.$
Anderson. We shall want your evidenceM-bM-^@M-^Tit will be important. It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$

$
The sun had risen before the preliminary interrogation and the search of$
the house and grounds had been concluded. Blewitt the detective, who had$
taken charge of the case, came into the dining-room, where a worried$
servant was serving coffee for the investigators, and dropped down on to$
a chair.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys one clue and thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys one clue alone,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, and drew from$
his pocket a soft hat. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you recognise this, Anderson?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\that was worn last night by the man I spoke to you$
about.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Cartwright?M-bM-^@M-^] said the detective.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I could swear to it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Where did you find it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Outside,M-bM-^@M-^] said the detective; M-bM-^@M-^\and that is all we have to go on. There$
is no sign of any body. My first theory stands.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You believe that the murderer carried Sir John and Lady Maxell into the$
car and drove away with them?M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy; M-bM-^@M-^\but that pre-supposes that$
the chauffeur was in the plot.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He may have been and he may have been terrorised,M-bM-^@M-^] said the detective.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Even a taxi-driver will be obliging if you stick a gun in his stomach.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt Miss Maxell have heardM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] began Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss Maxell heard,M-bM-^@M-^] said the detective, M-bM-^@M-^\but was afraid to look out.$
She also heard two shots. My theory is that Sir John and Lady Maxell$
were killed, that the murderer first locked both the bedrooms, went$
through Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys papers, presumably to discover something$
incriminating himself, and to destroy such documents.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But why not leave the bodies?M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Because without the bodies no indictment of murder could hold against$
him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy Anderson turned as the girl came in. She was looking very tired,$
but she was calmer than she had been earlier in the morning.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is there any news?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked, and Timothy shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We have searched every inch of the ground,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you thinkM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] She hesitated to ask the question.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I am afraid,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Timothy gently, M-bM-^@M-^\that there is very little hope.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But have you searched everywhere?M-bM-^@M-^] insisted the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Everywhere,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
$
Soon after, Timothy took the girl away to an hotel for breakfast and to$
arrange for a room, and the house was left in charge of the police.$
Later came the famous detective Gilborne, who made an independent$
search, but he, like his predecessors, failed to discover any further$
evidence, because he also knew nothing of the disused well, which lay$
hidden under a rubbish heap.$
$
$
$
$
                               CHAPTER XV$
$
$
WHO killed Sir John Maxell and his wife?$
$
Where had their bodies been hidden? These were the two questions which$
were to agitate England for the traditional space of nine days. For one$
day, at any rate, they formed the sole topic of speculation amongst the$
intelligent section of fifty million people.$
$
The first question was easier to answer than the second. It was obvious$
to the newsmen that the murderer was Cartwright, whose threats of$
vengeance were recalled and whose appearance at Bournemouth had been$
described at second-hand by the detective in charge of the case.$
First-hand information was for the moment denied the pressmen, for$
Timothy, fully dressed, lay on his bed in a sound sleep. Happily for$
him, neither then nor later did any of the enterprising newspaper men$
associate the M-bM-^@M-^\A. C.M-bM-^@M-^] in his name with the wanted criminal. He was at$
least spared that embarrassment.$
$
But the story of his vigil as M-bM-^@M-^\a friend of Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^YsM-bM-^@M-^] was in print long$
before he woke up to find a small and impatient army of reporters$
waiting to interview him. He answered the reportersM-bM-^@M-^Y interrogations as$
briefly as possible, bathed and changed and made his way to the hotel$
where the girl was. She was leaving as he arrived, and the warmth of her$
greeting almost banished the depression which lay upon him. She put her$
arm through his so naturally that he did not realise his wonderful$
fortune.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got something to tell you,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\unless you know already.$
All my money has gone.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He stopped with a gasp.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt mean that?M-bM-^@M-^] he said seriously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is true,M-bM-^@M-^] she replied. M-bM-^@M-^\I believe it was very little and my loss is$
so insignificant compared with the other awful affair that I am not$
worrying about it.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But Sir John had money?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She shook her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have just seen his lawyers,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\they have been to the bank$
and there is not a hundred pounds to his credit, and that amount will be$
absorbed by the cheques he has drawn. He drew a very, very large sum,$
including my money, from the bank two days ago. You know,M-bM-^@M-^] she went on,$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think that Sir John contemplated leaving for America? He had already$
given me a hint, asking me how long it would take me to pack my$
belongings, and I fancy that had something to do with the telegram he$
receivedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Announcing CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys escape,M-bM-^@M-^] nodded Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He was so kind and so gentle,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl, her eyes filling with$
tears, M-bM-^@M-^\that to me he was more like a father. Oh, it is awful, awful!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But you?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the agitated Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\What are you going to do? Good$
heavens! It is dreadful!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I shall have to work,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl practically and with a little$
smile. M-bM-^@M-^\I do not think that will kill me. Hundreds of thousands of girls$
have to work for their living, Timothy, and I shall have to work for$
mine.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy drew a long breath.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not if I can help it, you wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I am sure I shall make a$
lot of money. I can feel it in my bones. If a man takes a jobM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You mustnM-bM-^@M-^Yt talk like that,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, pressing his arm, M-bM-^@M-^\and anyway,$
how could I let you help me or keep me? That sort of thing isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
doneM-bM-^@M-^Tnot by nice girls.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She laughed, but became sober again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know that Sir John was very much interested in you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In me?M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
She nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I told you so the other day. I think he liked you, because he was$
saying how uncomfortable you must be at Vermont House, living in that$
queer little room of yours.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy was startled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How did he know I was living at Vermont House?M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
She smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Vermont House happens to be Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys property,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\In fact, I$
think it is the only realisable piece of property he has, now that the$
money has gone.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What shall you do immediately?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
She shook her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know,M-bM-^@M-^] she replied. M-bM-^@M-^\I think the first step is to get out of$
this hotel, which is much too expensive for me. I have a few pounds in$
the bank, but that wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt last very long.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
At his earnest entreaty she agreed to see a solicitor and appoint him to$
save whatever was possible from the wreckage of Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys estate. Two$
hours passed like as many minutes, until Timothy remembered that he had$
an appointment with a London reporterM-bM-^@M-^Tone Brennan. Brennan he had known$
in his cinema days, and Timothy literally fell upon his neck.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve nothing to tell the boys that hasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt already been told,M-bM-^@M-^] he said,$
putting down the newspaper which Brennan handed to him. M-bM-^@M-^\I am as anxious$
for news as you are. Have there been any developments?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\None,M-bM-^@M-^] said the reporter, M-bM-^@M-^\except that Sir John had no money at the$
bank and no money could be found in the house.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That I know,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\all his securities were drawn out two days ago.$
That was the stuff that Cartwright was after.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Does Miss Maxell knowM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] Brennan began.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She does know and she took it like a brick.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was about twenty thousand pounds,M-bM-^@M-^] Brennan went on. M-bM-^@M-^\The only other$
clue the police have is that the safe was opened by MaxellM-bM-^@M-^Ys duplicate$
key. The old man had two sets made, one of which he used to keep in his$
combination safe in his bedroom and the other he carried around with$
him. Miss Maxell told a story that the night before the murder Lady$
Maxell asked her to secure possession of the keys in order to open a$
bureau.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I see. Is it suggested that Lady Maxell detached the key of the safe$
and that it was she who opened it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is one theory,M-bM-^@M-^] said the other, M-bM-^@M-^\the police have miles of M-bM-^@M-^Yem!$
TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yve got everything except the bodies and the murderer. Now come out$
with that story, Anderson! You must know a great deal more than youM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
told, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym simply without a new fact that these evening papers$
havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt got, to hang my story on. Why did Cartwright come to your room,$
anyway? Do you know him?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He was an acquaintance of my fatherM-bM-^@M-^Ys,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically,$
M-bM-^@M-^\and perhaps he thought I knew Maxell better than I did.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That sounds pretty thin,M-bM-^@M-^] said the reporter. M-bM-^@M-^\Why should he come to$
you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose I am the only person he knew or knew about,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy$
patiently. M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose heM-bM-^@M-^Yd been all round Bournemouth trying to find a$
familiar name.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys something in that,M-bM-^@M-^] admitted the reporter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Anyway,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\I was a kid when he went to gaol. You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
imagine I knew him at all, do you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He had gone out to meet the girl, forgetting to take his watch, and now$
he was looking round for it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here is a theory,M-bM-^@M-^] said Brennan suddenly. M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose Lady Maxell isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
dead at all.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you mean?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the other.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Suppose Cartwright killed Maxell and Lady Maxell witnessed the murder.$
Suppose this fellow had to decide whether he would kill the witness or$
whether he would go away with her? You said the motor-car which came to$
the house in the middle of the night was the same as that in which Lady$
Maxell came home. IsnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it likely that she should have told the$
murderer, for some reason or other, that the car was coming, because$
evidently she had arranged for it to come, and that they went away$
together? IsnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it likely, too, that she was in the plot, and that, so$
far from being a victim, she was one of the criminals? We know her$
antecedents. There was some trouble over her stabbing a young American,$
Reggie van Rhyn. In fact, most of the evidence seems to incriminate her.$
There is the key, for example. Who else but she could have taken the$
duplicate key? DoesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it look as though she planned the whole thing,$
and that her accomplice came in at the last moment to help her get away$
and possibly to settle Sir John?$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take the incident of the two locked bedrooms. Obviously somebody who$
lived in the house and who knew the family routine must have done that.$
Both Sir John and Lady Maxell were in the habit of fastening their doors$
at night, and the servants did not go into the bedrooms unless they were$
rung for. It seems to me fairly clear that Lady Maxell locked the doors$
so that the suspicions of the servants should not be aroused in the$
morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If I had your powers of deduction,M-bM-^@M-^] said the admiring Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\I$
should never miss a winner. Where the blazes is my watch?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Try under the pillow,M-bM-^@M-^] said Brennan.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I never put it there,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Timothy, but nevertheless turned the$
pillow over and stood gaping.$
$
For beneath the pillow was a long, stout envelope with a tell-tale blood$
stain in one corner.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\For heavenM-bM-^@M-^Ys sake!M-bM-^@M-^] breathed Timothy, and took up the package.$
$
It bore no address and was sealed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What on earth is this?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I can tell you what those stains are,M-bM-^@M-^] said the practical Brennan. M-bM-^@M-^\Is$
there any name on it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Open it,M-bM-^@M-^] suggested the reporter, and the other obeyed.$
$
The contents were even more astonishing, for they consisted of a thick$
pad of money. They were new Bank of England notes and were bound about$
by a tight band of paper. On the band was written in Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
handwriting:$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\Proceeds of the sale of stocks held in trust for Miss Mary$
    Maxell. M-BM-#21,300.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
                 *        *        *        *        *$
$
The detective in charge of the case was a man of many theories. But his$
new theory was an uncomfortable one for Timothy Anderson.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This puts a new light upon the case,M-bM-^@M-^] said the detective, M-bM-^@M-^\and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
being perfectly frank with you, Mr. Anderson, that the new light isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
very favourable to you. Here you are, outside the building when the$
crime is committed. You are seen by a policeman a few minutes after the$
shots are fired, and a portion of the money stolen from the house is$
discovered under your pillow.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Discovered by me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\in the presence of a witness. And are$
you suggesting that, whilst I was with your policeman, I was also$
driving the car, or that I was wearing CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys cap which was found$
in the grounds? Anyway, youM-bM-^@M-^Yve the finger-print of your man and youM-bM-^@M-^Yre$
at liberty to compare it with mine.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a finger-print anyway,M-bM-^@M-^] said the detective, M-bM-^@M-^\it is the print$
of a knuckle and we do not keep a record of knuckles. No, I admit that$
the motor-car conflicts a little bit with my theory. Have you any$
suggestion to offer?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The only suggestion I can make,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\is that Cartwright, in a$
hurry to get away and knowing the position of my room, hid the money$
there for fear he should be caught with the goods. At any rate, if I$
were the criminal I would not hide a bloodstained envelope under my$
pillow. I should at least have the intelligence to burn the envelope and$
put the money where the servants of this house could not find it. Why,$
donM-bM-^@M-^Yt you see,M-bM-^@M-^] he said vigorously, M-bM-^@M-^\that any of the servants at this$
boarding-house would have found the envelope if I hadnM-bM-^@M-^Yt?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The detective scratched his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThereM-bM-^@M-^Ys something in that,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\It is a very queer case.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And it is being investigated by very queer people,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy$
irritably.$
$
A little further investigation, however, relieved Timothy of all$
suspicion. He had not returned to the house until ten oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock that$
morning. The maid, who had taken him a cup of tea at eight, noticing$
that he had been out all night, thought it was an excellent opportunity$
to straighten the room to M-bM-^@M-^\get it off her mind,M-bM-^@M-^] as she said. She did$
not remake the bed, but had tidied it. Whilst sweeping she had seen the$
envelope lying on the floor near the open window and had picked it up$
and, for want of a better place, thinking M-bM-^@M-^\it was privateM-bM-^@M-^] had slipped$
it under TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys pillow.$
$
As Timothy had not been out of sight of the police since the tragedy$
until his return to his lodgings, there could be no suggestion that he$
had any part in hiding the envelope. Whatever irritation he felt was$
dispelled by his large and generous satisfaction when the poverty which$
threatened Mary was averted. But why should Cartwright hide the money$
there? Why should he stop in his headlong flight to come to the window,$
as evidently he did, and throw the package into the room? There were a$
hundred places where he might have left it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That cousin stuff doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt work,M-bM-^@M-^] thought Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\and if you think$
heM-bM-^@M-^Ys going to rely upon his relationship with me and can use me to look$
after his money, heM-bM-^@M-^Ys made one large mistake.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He saw the girl again at the official inquiry, and met her on the day$
after. She was going to Bath where she had some distant relations, and$
they had met to say good-bye.$
$
It was a gloomy occasionM-bM-^@M-^Tless gloomy for Timothy than for the girl,$
because he was already planning a move to the town in which she was$
taking up her quarters. This cheerful view was banished, however, when$
she explained that her stay in Bath was merely a temporary expedient.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew has wired asking me to comeM-bM-^@M-^Tand it seems as good a place$
as any for a few months. I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt think I shall stay here any longer,M-bM-^@M-^]$
she said. M-bM-^@M-^\I want a change of air and a change of scene. Timothy, I feel$
that I shall never get over Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys death.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Never is a very long time, my dear,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy gently, and she could$
only wonder at the tender kindness in his voice.$
$
She had little time to wonder, however, for she had a proposition to$
make to him and she hardly knew how to reduce it to words.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Are youM-bM-^@M-^Tare youM-bM-^@M-^Tworking?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys broad smile answered her plainly that he was not.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The fact is,M-bM-^@M-^] he said airily, M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt quite decided what I am going$
to do. If you were going down to Bath for good, I was going down to Bath$
also. Maybe I could start a druggistM-bM-^@M-^Ys or buy a store, or run errands$
for somebody. I am the most accommodating worker.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WellM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] she began and stopped.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well?M-bM-^@M-^] he repeated.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I had an idea that maybe you would like to go on and conduct an$
independent searchM-bM-^@M-^Tindependent of the police, I meanM-bM-^@M-^Tand find$
something about the man who killed Sir John, and perhaps bring him to$
justice. You know, I think you are clever enough,M-bM-^@M-^] she went on$
hurriedly, M-bM-^@M-^\and it would be work after your own heart.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He was looking at her steadily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Quite right, Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said quietly, M-bM-^@M-^\but that involves spending a$
whole lot of money. What misguided person do you suggest would send me$
out on that kind of job?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, I thoughtM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] She hesitated, and then a little incoherently,$
M-bM-^@M-^\You see, I have the moneyM-bM-^@M-^Tmainly through youM-bM-^@M-^Tmy own money, I mean. I$
feel I have a duty to my poor uncle and I could trust you to do your$
very best. I could afford it, TimothyM-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tshe laid her hand on his arm and$
looked up at him almost beseechinglyM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\indeed I can afford it. I have$
more money than I shall ever spend.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He patted her hand softly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\it is just the kind of job I should like, and with$
anybodyM-bM-^@M-^Ys money but yours, why, IM-bM-^@M-^Yd be out of the country in two shakes,$
looking for Mr. Cartwright in the most expensive cities of the world.$
But, my dear, I cannot accept your commission, because I know just what$
lies behind it. You think IM-bM-^@M-^Ym a restless, rather shiftless sort of$
fellow, and you want to give me a good timeM-bM-^@M-^Twith your money.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He stopped and shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, my dear,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\thank you, but, no!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was disappointed and for a moment a little hurt.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Would two hundred poundsM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] she suggested timidly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not your two hundred,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\That lawyer of yours should take$
better care of your money, Mary. He shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt allow you to make these$
tempting offers to young men,M-bM-^@M-^] he was smiling now. M-bM-^@M-^\Will you go abroad?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\PerhapsM-bM-^@M-^Tsome day,M-bM-^@M-^] she said vaguely. M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John wanted me to goM-bM-^@M-^Tand I$
feel that I should be pleasing him. Some day, yes, Timothy.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Maybe IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go over at the same time as you,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I thought of$
taking a chance in Paris for a whileM-bM-^@M-^Tyou can make big money in Paris.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\InM-bM-^@M-^Ta while?M-bM-^@M-^] she smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\In a minute,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy grimly, M-bM-^@M-^\if the horse and the jockey are of$
the same way of thinking. I know a fellow who races pretty extensively$
in France. He has a horse called FlirtM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She held out her hand for the second time.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Timothy, youM-bM-^@M-^Yre incorrigible,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
She did not see him again for twelve months, not indeed until, after a$
winter spent in Madeira, she put her foot over the gangway of the s.s.$
_Tigilanes_ and met the quizzical smile of the youth who was waiting to$
receive her.$
$
For Timothy had been in Funchal a month, seeing but unseen, since Mary$
was generally in bed before the Casino woke up and play reached any$
exciting level.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER XVI$
$
$
TIMOTHY sat now on an upturned trunk, his elbows on the rails of the$
s.s. _Tigilanes_ and his speculative eye roving the river front of$
Liverpool.$
$
It was the last hour of the voyage, and Timothy, who had left Funchal$
with four hundred pounds in his pocket-book, had exactly three genuine$
shillings and a five-milreis piece of dubious quality.$
$
A man strolled along the deck and fell in at his side.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Cleaned you out last night, didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt they?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked sympathetically.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Eh? Oh, yes, I believe they did. That red-haired man had all the luck$
and most of the cards.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He smiled and Timothy had a swift, happy smile that brought tired little$
ridges under his eyes. He was not only good-looking and young, but he$
was interesting.$
$
The man at his side took the cigar from his teeth and looked at it$
before he spoke.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course, you know they were crooksM-bM-^@M-^Tthey work this coast line$
regularly.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Eh?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy looked round, shocked and pained.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You donM-bM-^@M-^Yt say? Crooks! What, that little red-haired fellow who has been$
trying to pick a quarrel with me all the voyage, and the tall,$
nice-looking Englishman?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
His companion nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you remember the Captain warned us not to play cardsM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They always do that to be on the safe side,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, but he was$
obviously uneasy. M-bM-^@M-^\Of course, if I knew they were crooksM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Knew! Good lord! Anybody will tell you. Ask the purser. Anyway, youM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
been stung and you can do nothing. The best thing to do is to grin and$
bear your losses. It is experience.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy felt the three honest shillings in his pocket and whistled$
dismally.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of course, if I were sureM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He turned abruptly away and raced down the main companion-way to the$
purserM-bM-^@M-^Ys little office under the stairs.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Macleod, I want to see you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, sir,M-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^Tall pursers are a little suspicious,M-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^\anything wrong with$
your bill?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\NoM-bM-^@M-^Tnot unless his nameM-bM-^@M-^Ys Bill. Shall I come in?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The purser opened the half-door and admitted him to the sanctuary.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There are two fellows aboard this packetM-bM-^@M-^Ta red-haired fellow named$
Chelwyn and a disguised duke named BrownM-bM-^@M-^Twhat do you know about M-bM-^@M-^Yem?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The purser made a face. It was intended to convey his lack of real$
interest in either.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll put it plainly,M-bM-^@M-^] said the patient Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Are they crooks?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They play cards,M-bM-^@M-^] said the purser diplomatically.$
$
He desired at this the eleventh hour to avoid scandal, explanations, and$
such other phenomena which he associated in his mind with the$
confrontation of the wise men and their dupes. That sort of thing$
brought the Line into disrepute, and indirectly reflected upon the$
shipM-bM-^@M-^Ys officers. Besides, the ship was making port, and, like all$
pursers, he was up to his eyes in work and frantically anxious to clear$
it off in a minimum time so that he could take a train to his little$
villa at Lytham, where his family was established.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mr. Anderson, if youM-bM-^@M-^Yve been stung,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but the$
captain gives fair warning the first night out of Cape Town and$
MadeiraM-bM-^@M-^TthatM-bM-^@M-^Ys where you came aboard, isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it?M-bM-^@M-^Tand there were notices$
posted up, both in the saloon and in the smoking-room. Have you lost$
much?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He looked up with some sympathy at the tall, athletic figure with the$
tired, smiling eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I cleared up M-BM-#500 at the Funchal Casino,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\and I reckon I$
have spent M-BM-#100 legitimately.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The rest is gone, eh?M-bM-^@M-^] said the purser. M-bM-^@M-^\Well, Mr. Anderson, I am$
afraid I can do nothing. The best thing to do is to mark it down against$
M-bM-^@M-^XExperienceM-bM-^@M-^Y.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll forgive you for being philosophical about my losses,M-bM-^@M-^] said$
Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Will you be kind enough to tell me the number of Mr. ChelwynM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
cabin?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Two seventy-four,M-bM-^@M-^] said the purser. M-bM-^@M-^\I say, Mr. Anderson, if I were you$
IM-bM-^@M-^Yd let the matter drop.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know you would, dear old thing,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, shaking him warmly by$
the hand, M-bM-^@M-^\and if I were you I should let it drop too. But, as I am$
meM-bM-^@M-^T274, I think you said?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I hope youM-bM-^@M-^Yre not going to make any trouble, Mr. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] said the$
alarmed purser. M-bM-^@M-^\WeM-bM-^@M-^Yve done our best to make you comfortable on the$
voyage.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And I did my best to pay for my ticket, so weM-bM-^@M-^Yre quits,M-bM-^@M-^] and with a$
wave of his hand Timothy strode out of the cabin, dodged down past the$
steward carrying up the luggage to the next deck, and walked swiftly$
along the carpeted corridor till he found a little number-plate bearing$
the figures M-bM-^@M-^\274.M-bM-^@M-^] He knocked at the cabin door, and gruff voice said,$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come in!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Chelwyn, the red-haired man, was in his shirt sleeves, fastening his$
collar. Brown was sitting on the edge of his bunk, smoking a cigarette,$
and Chelwyn, who had seen Timothy reflected in the mirror as he came in,$
was first to recognise him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hullo, Mr. Anderson, do you want anything?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked politely. M-bM-^@M-^\Sorry$
youM-bM-^@M-^Yve had such bad luckM-bM-^@M-^Twhat the devil are you doing?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy had shut the door and slipped the bolt.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, I want something,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You wantM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Listen. I thought you were playing straight, you fellows, or I wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
have played with you. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym willing to take a chance, for thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys my motto$
in life, dear lads, but there isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt a chance to take when youM-bM-^@M-^Yre playing$
with crooks.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Look here,M-bM-^@M-^] said the red-haired man, walking over to him and$
emphasising his words with his forefinger against TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys chest, M-bM-^@M-^\that$
kind of stuff doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt amuse me. If you lose your money, lose it like a$
sportsman and a gentleman, and donM-bM-^@M-^Yt squeal.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy grinned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Boys,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\I want four hundred pounds from you, so step lively.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The suave Mr. Brown, who had been watching the scene with bored eyes,$
stroking his drooping moustache the while, made a gentle entrance into$
the conversation.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym rather surprised, in fact, I am shocked, Mr. Anderson, that you$
should take this line,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve lost your money fairly and$
squarelyM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys where youM-bM-^@M-^Yre lying,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy pleasantly. M-bM-^@M-^\Now, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym telling$
you this. WeM-bM-^@M-^Yre very near the shore. Somewhere at the back of those$
warehouses thereM-bM-^@M-^Ys certain to be a police organisation and a well-paid$
magistrate. You are going to have a grand opportunity of appearing in$
the respectable part of the court as a prosecutor, for IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to beat$
you upM-bM-^@M-^Tfirst you,M-bM-^@M-^] he pointed to the red-haired Chelwyn, M-bM-^@M-^\and then$
you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre going to beat me up, are you?M-bM-^@M-^] said the red-haired man and made$
a quick dive.$
$
It was not pretty to watch, unless you took an interest in fighting.$
They closed for a second and something jolted twice under ChelwynM-bM-^@M-^Ys jaw.$
He fell back against the cabin partition. He leapt again, but TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
fist met him half-way, and he never really felt what hit him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve won this fight,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\and I award myself a purse of four$
hundred pounds. Do you take any interest in these proceedings. Brown?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The other man had not moved from his bunk, but now he rose and lifted$
his dazed companion to his feet.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WeM-bM-^@M-^Yd better pay this fellow.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll see himM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] mumbled the other, but Brown was apparently the$
brains of the organisation and had merely mentioned his intention of$
paying out of sheer politeness to his companion.$
$
He took a thick pocket-book from his hip pocket and counted out the$
notes, and Timothy picked them up.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll fix you for this,M-bM-^@M-^] said Chelwyn, mopping his bleeding lip. M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve$
taken this from meM-bM-^@M-^Tnot him.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt frighten me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy as he unbolted the door and stepped$
out.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Some day IM-bM-^@M-^Yll get you,M-bM-^@M-^] said the livid man, and the finger he pointed$
at Timothy was shaking with anger.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll take a chance on that,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
He ascended the companion-way feeling remarkably cheerful, and met the$
purser coming down. That officer regarded him even more suspiciously$
than ever. But as there were no signs of the fray upon him, the purser$
went to his cabin relieved, and Timothy passed out to relieve his$
feelings by the side of the rail. So he sat whilst the big liner was$
brought alongside the wharf, and then he heard his name spoken and$
jumped up, hat in hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I just wanted to tell you, Timothy, in case I did not see you on the$
train,M-bM-^@M-^] she remarked, M-bM-^@M-^\that Mrs. Renfrew has decided not to go back to$
Bath but to go on to Paris almost immediately.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Good for Mrs. Renfrew,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Bath or Paris will find me$
hanging around. I nearly came down to you just now to borrow my fare to$
Bath.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Timothy,M-bM-^@M-^] she said in a shocked voice, M-bM-^@M-^\did you lose all the money you$
won in Funchal?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy rubbed his nose.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt exactly lose it,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I lent it and it has just been$
repaid.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt think it proper your travelling on the same boat.$
She thinks you ought not to have come to Madeira after meM-bM-^@M-^Tus.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
There was mischief in MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys eyes, in spite of the solemnity of her$
tone.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I shouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt worry about what Mrs. Renfrew thinks,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Why,$
youM-bM-^@M-^Yre almost as badly off for cousins as I am.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\As you are?M-bM-^@M-^] she said in surprise. M-bM-^@M-^\Have you any cousins?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hundreds of M-bM-^@M-^Yem,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy glibly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who are they?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked, interested.$
$
She had reached a stage in their friendship when his relatives were$
immensely interesting.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know their names,M-bM-^@M-^] lied Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt give M-bM-^@M-^Yem names but$
numbersM-bM-^@M-^Tone, two, three, four, etc.M-bM-^@M-^Tjust at that moment I was thinking$
of number seventy-nineM-bM-^@M-^Tgood morning, Mrs. Renfrew.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mrs. Renfrew was severe and thin, with a yellow face and hooked nose.$
She was a member of one of the best, if not the best, families in Bath,$
and it was an unfailing source of pride that she did not know the people$
that other people knew.$
$
Mary watched the encounter with dancing eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shall I have the pleasure of your company to London?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Mrs.$
Renfrew.$
$
She invariably made a point of leaving Mary out, and indeed sustained$
the pleasant fiction that Mary had no existence on board the ship.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The pleasure will be mine,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I am not travelling with you$
to London.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He said this so innocently that Mrs. Renfrew was in the middle of her$
next observation before she had any idea that the remark had an$
offensive interpretation.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You seem to have had a very unfortunate experienceM-bM-^@M-^Twhat do you mean?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Happily a very hot-looking steward made his appearance at that moment$
and called Mrs. Renfrew away. She gathered up her charge and with a$
withering glance at Timothy departed.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Take A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^] Anderson, feeling particularly happy, was one of the$
first to land and strolled along the quay-side waiting within view of$
the gangway for Mary to disembark. Immediately above him towered the$
high decks of the _Tigilanes_M-bM-^@M-^Ta fact of which he was reminded when,$
with a crash, a heavy wooden bucket dropped so close to his head that it$
grazed his shoulder. It was a large bucket, and, dropped from that$
height, might have caused him considerable physical distress.$
$
He looked up.$
$
The two card-players with whom he had had some argument were lolling$
over the rail, their faces turned in quite another direction and talking$
earnestly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Hi!M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
They were deaf, it appeared, for they still continued their discussion.$
A deck hand was passing with a crate load of oranges; one fell out and$
Timothy picked it up. The attention of Messrs. Chelwyn and Brown was$
still directed elsewhere, and with a little swing of his arm Timothy$
sent the orange upon its swift and unerring course. It caught the$
red-haired man square in the side of the face and burst, and he jumped$
round with an oath.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve dropped your bucket,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy sweetly. M-bM-^@M-^\Shall I throw it at$
you or will you come down and get it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The man said something violent, but his companion pulled him away, and$
Timothy went to look for a seat with peace in his heart.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER XVII$
$
$
THE train was crowded, but he secured a corner seat in one of the$
cell-like compartments. It was empty when he entered, but immediately$
after, to his surprise, Brown and Chelwyn followed him in and deposited$
their goods upon three seats that they might in the manner of all$
experienced travellers, occupy breathing space for three at the cost of$
two tickets.$
$
They took no notice of Timothy until the train drew out and he wondered$
what their game was. It was hardly likely that they would start any$
rough work with him after their experience of the morning and less$
likely because these boat trains were well policed.$
$
Clear of the Riverside Station the smooth Englishman leant forward.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I hope, Mr. Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\that you will forget and forgive.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Surely,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\I have nothing to forgive.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My friend,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown with a smile, M-bM-^@M-^\is very precipitateM-bM-^@M-^Twhich$
means hasty,M-bM-^@M-^] he explained.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Thank you,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\I thought it meant crooked.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
A spasm contorted the features of Mr. Chelwyn, but he said nothing. As$
for Brown, he laughed. He laughed heartily but spuriously.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys not a bad joke,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but to tell you the truth, we mistook$
you forM-bM-^@M-^Tone of us, and my friend and I thought it would be a good joke$
to get the better of you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And was it?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was and it wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown, not easily nonplussed. M-bM-^@M-^\Of$
course, we intended restoring the money to you before you left the$
ship.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Naturally,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I never thought you would do anything else.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Only you know you rather spoilt our little _esprit_.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If the conversation is to develop in a foreign language,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy,$
M-bM-^@M-^\I would only remark: _Honi soit qui mal y pense_,M-bM-^@M-^] and the polite Mr.$
Brown laughed again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You do not mind if my friend and I have a little quiet game by$
ourselves, if,M-bM-^@M-^] he said humorously, M-bM-^@M-^\we swindle one another.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not at all,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I have no objection to watching, but if,M-bM-^@M-^]$
he said cheerfully, M-bM-^@M-^\you should suddenly draw my attention whilst your$
friendM-bM-^@M-^Ys head is turned, to the ease with which I could win a hundred$
pounds by picking the lady, or discovering the little pea under the$
little shell, or show me a way of getting rich from any of the other$
devices which the children of the public schools find so alluring at the$
country fair, I shall be under the painful necessity of slapping you$
violently on the wrist.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Thereafter the conversation languished until the train had run through$
Crewe and was approaching Rugby. It was here that Mr. Brown stopped in$
the midst of a long, learned discussion on English politics to offer his$
cigarette-case to Timothy. Timothy chose a cigarette and put it in his$
pocket.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is one of the best Egyptian brands made,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown casually.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Best for you or best for me?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Bah!M-bM-^@M-^] It was the red-haired Chelwyn who addressed him for the first$
time. M-bM-^@M-^\What have you to be afraid of? YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre as scared as a cat! Do you$
think we want to poison you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mr. Brown produced a flask and poured a modicum of whisky into the cup$
and handed it to his companion, then he drank himself. Then, without$
invitation he poured a little more into the cup and offered it to$
Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Let bygones be bygones,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have no desire to be a bygone,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\I would much rather be$
a herenow.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Nevertheless, he took the cup and smelt it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Butyl chloride,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\has a distinctive odour. I suppose you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt$

knock-out drop.M-bM-^@M-^Y Really,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, handing back the cup, M-bM-^@M-^\you boys are$
so elementary. Where did you learn it allM-bM-^@M-^Tfrom the movies?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The red-haired man half rose from his seat with a growl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Sit down,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply, and with a jerk of his hand he flung$
open the carriage door.$
$
The men shrank back at the sight of the rapidly running line, and at the$
certainty of death which awaited any who left the train on that side of$
the carriage.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Start something,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\and IM-bM-^@M-^Yll undertake to put either one$
or both of you on to the line. WeM-bM-^@M-^Yre going at about sixty miles an hour,$
and a fellow that went out there wouldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt be taking a chance. Now is$
there going to be a rough house?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Close the door, close the door,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mr. Brown nervously. M-bM-^@M-^\What a$
stupid idea, Mr. Anderson!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy swung the door to and the man moved up towards him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, IM-bM-^@M-^Ym just going to put it to you plainly,M-bM-^@M-^] said Brown. M-bM-^@M-^\WeM-bM-^@M-^Yve made$
the voyage out to the Cape and the voyage back and the only mug we met$
was you. What we won from you just about paid our expenses, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$
putting it to you, as a sportsman and a gentleman, that you should let$
us have half of that stuff back.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The sportsman in me admires your nerve,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\but I suppose$
it is the gentleman part that returns an indignant M-bM-^@M-^XNo!M-bM-^@M-^Y to your$
interesting observation.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Brown turned to his companion.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys that, Len,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\youM-bM-^@M-^Yll just have to let the money$
go. It is a pity,M-bM-^@M-^] he said wistfully and his companion grunted.$
$
That ended the conversation so far as the journey was concerned, and$
Timothy heard no more until he was in the gloomy courtyard at Euston$
Station and stepping into his taxi.$
$
To his surprise it was the red-haired man who approached him, and$
something in his manner prevented Timothy from taking the action which$
he otherwise would have thought necessary.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Look here, young fellow,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\you watch BrownM-bM-^@M-^TheM-bM-^@M-^Ys wild.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre not exactly tame,M-bM-^@M-^] smiled Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt take any notice of me,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man a little bitterly. M-bM-^@M-^\I am$
engaged in the rough work. I should have got two hundred out of your$
moneyM-bM-^@M-^TthatM-bM-^@M-^Ys what made me so wild. Brown paid all my expenses and gives$
me ten pound a week and a commission. It sounds funny to you, doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
it, but it is the truth,M-bM-^@M-^] and somehow Timothy knew that the man was not$
lying.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\HeM-bM-^@M-^Ys finished with meM-bM-^@M-^Tsays I am a hoodoo,M-bM-^@M-^] said the little man. M-bM-^@M-^\Do$
you know what IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got out of five weeksM-bM-^@M-^Y work? Look!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He held out his hand and disclosed two ten-pound notes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\BrownM-bM-^@M-^Ys dangerous,M-bM-^@M-^] he warned Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you make any mistake$
about that. I was only wild because I was losing my money, but heM-bM-^@M-^Ys wild$
because youM-bM-^@M-^Yve got fresh with him and caught him out every time. Good$
night!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Here, wait,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
He felt in his pocket.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If youM-bM-^@M-^Yre lying, it is a plausible lie and one that pleases me,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said. M-bM-^@M-^\This will salve my conscience.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He slipped two notes into the manM-bM-^@M-^Ys hands.$
$
Chelwyn was speechless for a moment. Then he asked:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And where are you staying in London, Mr. Anderson?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\At the Brussell Hotel,M-bM-^@M-^] repeated the other, M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll remember that. I$
shall hear if anything is going on and IM-bM-^@M-^Yll M-bM-^@M-^Yphone you. YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre a$
gentleman, Mr. Anderson.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\So Mr. Brown said,M-bM-^@M-^] remarked Timothy and drove off, feeling unusually$
cheerful.$
$
If Timothy could be cheerful under the depressing conditions which$
prevailed on the night of his arrival in London, he was a veritable$
pattern of cheer. A drizzling rain was falling as the taxi squeaked its$
way through a labyrinth of mean streets. He had glimpses of$
wretched-looking people, grotesque of shape and unreal, through the$
rain-blurred window of the cab.$
$
Then suddenly the character of the streets changed, and he was in a$
broad street twinkling with light. There was a glimpse of trees, wide$
open spaces, dotted with light. The street grew busier and the traffic$
thicker, then suddenly the cab turned again into semi-darkness and$
pulled up before the hotel.$
$
A porter opened the door.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do I think of Madeira?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy of the astonished man. M-bM-^@M-^\I$
havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt had time to think. Will I be staying long in London? No. What$
are my opinions of the political crisis which has arisen in my absence?$
I would rather not say.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It takes a great deal to upset the equilibrium of a well-conducted hall$
man.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Have you booked your room?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
Timothy meekly admitted that he had.$
$
He woke to a London much more beautiful, to a vista of old-world$
buildings such as Cruikshank loved to draw, to a green square and$
glimpses of greener trees.$
$
Mary was staying at the Carlton, but he had arranged to meet her for$
lunch. He had not arranged to meet her dragon, but he knew she would be$
there. He had breakfasted, and was on the point of leaving the hotel,$
when Chelwyn came.$
$
To say that Timothy regretted his generosity of the night before would$
be to do him an injustice. Nevertheless, he had some misgivings as to$
whether he had not been a little too generous. The appearance of Mr.$
Chelwyn, early in the morning, looking so spruce and confident, was in$
itself a suspicious happening, though events proved that the suspicion$
was unfounded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Can I see you alone for a moment, Mr. Anderson?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the red-haired$
man.$
$
Timothy hesitated.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Come along to the drawing-room,M-bM-^@M-^] he said.$
$
It was the one public room which would be empty at that time of the$
morning. Mr. Chelwyn deposited his hat and stick and brand-new yellow$
gloves before he spoke.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, Mr. Anderson, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve come to tell you a few facts which will$
surprise you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt had a gold brick sent to you by your Uncle George in$
Alaska, have you?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy dubiously. M-bM-^@M-^\Because IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not buying that$
kind of fact.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The man smiled and shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is hardly likely I should try that stuff on you, sir,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\No,$
this is a much more serious matter. Before I go any farther IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell$
you that I am not asking for money. I am grateful to you for what you$
did to me last night, Mr. Anderson. A crook has a wife and children the$
same as anybody else. I have been in this funny business for ten years,$
but now IM-bM-^@M-^Ym out of it for good.M-bM-^@M-^] He looked round and dropped his voice,$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Anderson, I told you last night that weM-bM-^@M-^Yve been five or six weeks$
away from England. DidnM-bM-^@M-^Yt that sound strange to you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not to me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That is because you donM-bM-^@M-^Yt know the game,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man. M-bM-^@M-^\As a rule,$
when weM-bM-^@M-^Yre working these liners, we go out to Cape Town and come back by$
the next ship that sails. What do you think we stayed at Funchal$
forM-bM-^@M-^TthereM-bM-^@M-^Ys no money in short voyagesM-bM-^@M-^TitM-bM-^@M-^Ys all on the long run from$
Madeira to Cape Town.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I havenM-bM-^@M-^Yt the slightest idea,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy wearily. M-bM-^@M-^\I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt even$
remember seeing you in FunchalM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We laid low,M-bM-^@M-^] interrupted the man.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That may be, but if youM-bM-^@M-^Yve come to tell me the interesting story of$
your life, Ginger, I beg that you will cut it shortM-bM-^@M-^Tthe history, I$
mean, not necessarily your life.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll tell it to you as quickly as possible,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man. M-bM-^@M-^\I$
donM-bM-^@M-^Yt always work with Brown. In fact, IM-bM-^@M-^Yve only worked with him about$
three times before. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not as good a man with the broadsM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The broads?M-bM-^@M-^] said the puzzled Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\With the cards,M-bM-^@M-^] corrected the man. M-bM-^@M-^\I say that IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not as good a man$
with the broads as some of the others. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve got a bit of a reputation$
for scrapping. IM-bM-^@M-^Yve never left a pal in the lurch and IM-bM-^@M-^Yve always been$
ready for any M-bM-^@M-^Xrough houseM-bM-^@M-^Y that came along. About two months ago Brown$
sent for meM-bM-^@M-^TheM-bM-^@M-^Ys got a flat off Piccadilly and lives like a lord. He$
told me he was going to Madeira on a special job, that heM-bM-^@M-^Yd been$
employed by a lady in ParisM-bM-^@M-^Ta Madame Serpilot (youM-bM-^@M-^Yd better write that$
down in your pocket-book)M-bM-^@M-^Tto shepherd a young lady who was coming over.$
Mind you, there was no harm intended to the young lady, but the general$
idea was that she might be accompanied by a man, and he was the fellow$
who had to be looked after.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What was the ladyM-bM-^@M-^Ys name?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Miss Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man without hesitation, M-bM-^@M-^\and you were the fellow$
we were asked to put out of business. BrownM-bM-^@M-^Ys idea was to break you;$
then, when you got to London, one of his pals would have met you and$
offered to lend you money. TheyM-bM-^@M-^Yd have framed up a charge against you of$
obtaining money by false pretences, and you would have been pinched.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys eyebrows rose.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Was this Mrs. SerpilotM-bM-^@M-^Ys plan?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked, but the man shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, sir, she gave just the details to Brown. She never said what was to$
be done to you, according to him, but you were to be stopped going$
around with the young lady.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who is Madame Serpilot?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There youM-bM-^@M-^Yve got me,M-bM-^@M-^] said Chelwyn. M-bM-^@M-^\I believe sheM-bM-^@M-^Ys an old widow, but$
Brown never told me much about her. He got instructions from her while$
he was in Paris, but I never discovered how. I went to Madeira with him$
because he knew I was toughM-bM-^@M-^Tbut I wasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt tough enough,M-bM-^@M-^] he added with a$
dry smile.$
$
Timothy held out his hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ginger,M-bM-^@M-^] he said solemnly, M-bM-^@M-^\please forgive the orange!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, I didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt mind that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man, M-bM-^@M-^\thatM-bM-^@M-^Ys all in the dayM-bM-^@M-^Ys work.$
It made me a bit wild, and my eyeM-bM-^@M-^Ys feeling sore, but donM-bM-^@M-^Yt let that$
worry you. What youM-bM-^@M-^Yve got to do now is to look out for Brown, because$
heM-bM-^@M-^Yll have you as sure as death.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll look out for Madame Serpilot, too,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\I think IM-bM-^@M-^Yll go$
to Paris.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\SheM-bM-^@M-^Ys not in Paris now, I can tell you that,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man. M-bM-^@M-^\The wire$
Brown got at Liverpool was from Monte Carlo.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Monte Carlo,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\is even more attractive than Paris.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
$

$
                             CHAPTER XVIII$
$
$
CHELWYN left Timothy with something to think about. Who was Madame$
Serpilot, this old lady who had such an interest in Mary travelling$
alone? And why, oh! why had she left Paris for Monte Carlo at the fag$
end of the season? For he and Mary had privately decided between them$
that London and Paris should only be stopping places on the route to the$
Riviera. Why should Madame Serpilot have changed her plans at the same$
time? There was something more than a coincidence in this. At lunch-time$
he had Mary to herself, her chaperon having a headache.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\can you tell me why we changed our plans on the boat$
and decided to go straight on to Monte Carlo instead of staying in$
Paris?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] she said readily. M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you remember my telling you about those$
beautiful books of views that I saw on the ship?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where did you see them?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I found them in my cabin one day. I think the steward must have left$
them,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\They were most wonderful productions, full of coloured$
prints and photographsM-bM-^@M-^TdidnM-bM-^@M-^Yt I tell you about them?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I remember,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy slowly. M-bM-^@M-^\Found them in your cabin, eh? Well,$
nobody left any beautiful or attractive pictures of Monte Carlo in my$
berth, but I think that wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt stop me going on to Monte Carlo.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was an opportunity she had been seeking for a week and she seized it.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I want to ask you something, Timothy,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Mrs. Renfrew told me$
the other day that they call you M-bM-^@M-^XTake A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^Y Anderson. Why is that,$
Timothy?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Because I take a chance, I suppose,M-bM-^@M-^] he smiled. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been taking$
chances all my life.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre not a gambler, Timothy, are you?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked gravely. M-bM-^@M-^\I know you$
bet and play cards, but men do that for amusement, and somehow it is all$
right. But when men start out to make a living, and actually make a$
living, by games of chance, they somehow belong to another life and$
another people.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He was silent.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre just too good to go that way, Timothy,M-bM-^@M-^] she went on. M-bM-^@M-^\There are$
lots of chances that a man can take in this world, in matching his$
brains, his strength and his skill against other men, and when he wins$
his stake is safe. He doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt lose it the next day or the next month,$
and heM-bM-^@M-^Ys picking winners all the time, Timothy.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
His first inclination was to be nettled. She was wounding the tender$
skin of his vanity, and he was startled to discover how tender a skin$
that was. All that she said was true and less than true. She could not$
guess how far his mind and inclination were from commonplace labour and$
how very little work came into the calculations of his future. He looked$
upon a job as a thing not to be held and developed into something$
better, but as a stopgap between two successful chances. He was almost$
shocked when this truth came home to him. The girl was nervous, and$
painfully anxious not to hurt him, and yet well aware that she was$
rubbing a sore place.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Timothy, for your sake, as well as for mine, for youM-bM-^@M-^Yre a friend of$
mine, I want to be proud of you, to see you past this present phase of$
life. Mrs. Renfrew speaks of you as a gambler, and says your name, even$
at your age, is well known as one who would rather bet than buy. That$
isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt true, Timothy, is it?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She put her hand on his and looked into his face. He did not meet her$
eyes.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think that is true, Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said steadily. M-bM-^@M-^\How it comes to be$
true, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt quite know. I suppose I have drifted a little over the$
line, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym grateful to you for pulling me up. Oh, no, I donM-bM-^@M-^Yt regret$
the pastM-bM-^@M-^Tit has all been usefulM-bM-^@M-^Tand I have made good on chances, but I$
see there are other chances that a man can take than putting his money$
on the pace of a horse or backing against zero. Maybe, when I get back$
to London IM-bM-^@M-^Yll settle down into a respectable citizen and keep hens or$
something.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He was speaking seriously, though at first she thought he was being$
sarcastic.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And you wonM-bM-^@M-^Yt gamble again?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
He hesitated to reply.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\That isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt fair,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quickly. M-bM-^@M-^\I mean it isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt fair of me to ask$
you. It is almost cruel,M-bM-^@M-^] she smiled, M-bM-^@M-^\to let you go to Monte Carlo and$
ask you not to put money on the tables. But promise me, Timothy, that$
when I tell you to stop playing, you will stop.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\HereM-bM-^@M-^Ys my hand on it,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, brightening up already at the$
prospect of being allowed to gamble at all. M-bM-^@M-^\HereafterM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] He raised$
his hand solemnly. M-bM-^@M-^\By the way,M-bM-^@M-^] he asked, M-bM-^@M-^\do you know a lady named$
Madame Serpilot?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She shook her head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, I do not,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\I have never heard the name.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You have no relations or friends in France?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\None,M-bM-^@M-^] she replied immediately.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What made you go to France at all?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked. M-bM-^@M-^\When I heard from you,$
Mary, you talked about taking a holiday in Madeira before setting up$
house in Bath, and the first thing I knew of your intention to go abroad$
again was the letter you sent me just before I started for Madeira.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I wanted to go a year ago, after Sir JohnM-bM-^@M-^Ys death,M-bM-^@M-^] she said; M-bM-^@M-^\then$
Mrs. Renfrew couldnM-bM-^@M-^Yt take the tripM-bM-^@M-^Tone of her younger children had$
measles.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Has that woman children?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy in an awed voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt be absurd. Of course she has children. It was she who decided on$
making the trip. She writes little articles in the _Bath County$
Herald_M-bM-^@M-^Ta local paperM-bM-^@M-^Ton the care of children and all that sort of$
thing. SheM-bM-^@M-^Ys not really a journalist, she is literary.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\sometimes they write poetry, sometimes recipes$
for ice creamM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^Xtake three cups of flour, a pint of cream in which an$
egg has been boiled and a pinch of vanillaM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl smiled. Evidently Timothy had hit upon the particular brand of$
journalism to which Mrs. Renfrew was addicted.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl, M-bM-^@M-^\there was to have been a sort of MothersM-bM-^@M-^Y$
Welfare Meeting in Paris next weekM-bM-^@M-^Tan International affairM-bM-^@M-^Tand when we$
were in Madeira she received an invitation to attend with a free return$
ticketM-bM-^@M-^TwasnM-bM-^@M-^Yt that splendid?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Splendid,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy absently. M-bM-^@M-^\Naturally you thought it was an$
excellent opportunity to go also.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\And now you have arrived here you find that the MothersM-bM-^@M-^Y Welfare$
Meeting has been postponed for ten years?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked at him, startled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How did you know that the meeting had been postponed?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, I guessed it,M-bM-^@M-^] he said airily, M-bM-^@M-^\such things have happened before.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The truth is,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl, M-bM-^@M-^\nobody knows anything about this$
meeting, and the letter which Mrs. Renfrew sent to the MothersM-bM-^@M-^Y Welfare$
Society in Paris was waiting for us when we arrived at the Carlton. It$
had been returnedM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^XAddressee Unknown.M-bM-^@M-^Y Mrs. Renfrew had put the Carlton$
address inside.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Here was ample excuse for speculation of an innocuous kind. Mrs. Renfrew$
had been approached because it was known by this mysterious somebody$
that she would take the girl with her, and this sinister somebody had$
hired two thugs to shepherd her from Madeira and to put Timothy out of$
action, should he decide to accompany the party to France. The situation$
was distinctly interesting.$
$
Three days later the party crossed the Channel. Timothy had high hopes$
of adventure, which were fated to be more than fulfilled. They stayed$
three days in Paris and he had the time of his life. He went to the$
races at Maisons Lafitte, and came back glowing with a sense of his$
virtue, for he had not made a bet. He drifted in to the baccara rooms at$
Enghien, watched tens of thousands of francs change hands, and returned$
to Paris that night with a halo fitted by MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys own hands.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I think youM-bM-^@M-^Yre really wonderful, Timothy,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\You know you are$
allowed one final flutter.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym saving that up for Monte Carlo,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
Since his arrival in Paris he had lost the right to his name, for he was$
taking no chances. If he went abroad at night he kept to the brilliantly$
illuminated boulevards or the crowded cafM-CM-)s. He kept clear of the$
crowdsM-bM-^@M-^Tespecially crowds which formed quickly and for no apparent$
reason.$
$
He was taking no chances because he felt it was not fair upon the$
particular genius who presided over his destinies that he should$
squander his luck in a miraculous escape from death or disablement. Only$
once, when dining at the Scribe, did he think he saw the familiar face$
of Mr. Brown. With an apology he left the two ladies and made his way$
with difficulty through the crowded restaurant, only to find that his$
man had disappeared.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\These cafM-CM-)s have as many doors as a trick-scene,M-bM-^@M-^] he grumbled when he$
came back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Did you see a friend of yours?M-bM-^@M-^] asked the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not so much a friend as one who has a financial interest in me,M-bM-^@M-^]$
replied Timothy.$
$
Mrs. Renfrew had thawed a little under the beneficent influences of$
Paris. She was busy sending off picture-postcards and had written to$
Bath her first impression of the French capital to the extent of three$
columns. She had also written a poem which began: M-bM-^@M-^\Oh, city of light$
that shines so bright,M-bM-^@M-^] and went on rhyming M-bM-^@M-^\vainM-bM-^@M-^] with M-bM-^@M-^\Seine,M-bM-^@M-^] M-bM-^@M-^\gayM-bM-^@M-^]$
with M-bM-^@M-^\play,M-bM-^@M-^] M-bM-^@M-^\joyM-bM-^@M-^] with M-bM-^@M-^\alloy,M-bM-^@M-^] through twenty-three stanzas.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I rather pride myself,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew, M-bM-^@M-^\upon that description of$
ParisM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^Xthe city of light.M-bM-^@M-^Y DonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you think it is very original, Mr.$
Anderson?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It was,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy diplomatically. M-bM-^@M-^\Parisians have called it the$
M-bM-^@M-^XVille LumiM-CM-(reM-bM-^@M-^Y for about two hundred years.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys almost the same, isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt it?M-bM-^@M-^] said Mrs. Renfrew. M-bM-^@M-^\How clever the$
French are!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Mrs. Renfrew did not speak French and took a more generous view of the$
young man when she discovered that he did. It fell to TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys lot to$
order tickets, arrange cabs, pay bills and act as unofficial courier to$
the party. He was anxious to be gone from Paris, impatient for the big$
game to begin. For some reason, he did not anticipate that any harm$
would come to the girl. This struck him as strange later, but at the$
moment all his thoughts were centred upon the match between himself and$
this old French lady who had set herself out to separate him from Mary$
Maxell.$
$
No unpleasant incidentM-bM-^@M-^Tthe crowded condition of the dining-car$
exceptedM-bM-^@M-^Tmarred the journey to Monte Carlo. There was the inevitable$
night spent in a stuffy sleeping-berth in a car that rocked and swayed$
to such an extent that Timothy expected it to jump the line, as$
thousands of other passengers have expected it to do; and they came with$
the morning to the Valley of the Rhone, a wide, blue, white-flecked$
stream flowing between gaunt hills, past solitary chM-CM-"teaux and strange$
walled towns, which looked as if they had been kept under glass cases$
for centuries, that the modern world should be reminded of the dangers$
under which our forefathers lived. So to Marseilles, and a long, hot and$
slow journey to Nice.$
$
To the girl it was a pilgrimage of joy. She would not have missed a$
single moment of that ride. The blue sea, the white villas with their$
green jalousies, the banked roses over wall and pergola and the$
warm-scented breeze, and above all the semi-tropical sun, placed her in$
a new world, a wonder world more beautiful than imagination had painted.$
$
There is something about Monte Carlo which is very satisfying. It is so$
orderly, so clean, so white and bright, that you have the impression$
that it is carefully dusted every morning and that the villas on the$
hills are taken down weekly by tender hands, polished and replaced.$
$
There is nothing garish about Monte Carlo, for all its stucco and$
plaster. Some of the buildings, and particularly the Casino, were$
compared by the irreverent Timothy to the White City, but it was a$
refined White City and the Casino itself, with its glass-roofed porch,$
its great, solemn hanging lamps and its decorous uniformed attendants,$
had something of the air of a National Bank.$
$
Timothy took a room at the HM-CM-4tel de Paris, where the girl was staying,$
and lost no time in seeking information.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?M-bM-^@M-^] said the concierge. M-bM-^@M-^\There is a madame who bears that$
name, I think, but she is not staying here, monsieur.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of whom should I inquire, I pray you?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy in the vernacular.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Of the Municipal Council, monsieur,M-bM-^@M-^] said the concierge, M-bM-^@M-^\or, if the$
madame is a wealthy madame, of the manager of the Credit Lyonnais, who$
will perhaps inform monsieur.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Thanks many times,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
He went first to the Credit Lyonnais, and found the manager extremely$
polite but uncommunicative. It was not the practice of the bank, he$
said, to disclose the addresses of their clients. He would not say that$
Madame Serpilot was his client, but if she were, he could certainly not$
give her address to any unauthorised person. From this Timothy gathered$
that Madame Serpilot was a client. He went on to the Mairie and met with$
better fortune. The Mairie had no respect for persons. It was there to$
supply information and what the Mairie of Monte Carlo does not know$
about Monaco, the cleverest detective force in the world would be$
wasting its time trying to discover.$
$
Madame Serpilot lived at the Villa Condamine. The Villa Condamine was$
not, as the name suggested, in the poorer part of Monte Carlo but in$
that most exclusive territory, the tiny peninsula of Cap Martin.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Has madam been a resident long?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\For one hundred and twenty-nine days,M-bM-^@M-^] replied the official promptly.$
M-bM-^@M-^\Madame hired the villa furnished from the agent, of the Grand Duchess$
Eleana who, alas! was destroyed in that terrible revolution.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He gave Timothy some details of the family from which the Grand Duchess$
had sprung, the amount of her income in pre-war days, and was passing to$
her eccentricities when Timothy took his departure. He was not$
interested in the Grand Duchess Eleana, alive or dead.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER XIX$
$
$
HE went to the house agent on the main street and from him procured$
the exact position of Madame SerpilotM-bM-^@M-^Ys residence.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\An old madame?M-bM-^@M-^] said the agent. M-bM-^@M-^\No, monsieur, I cannot say that she is$
old. And I cannot say that she is young.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He thought a moment, as though endeavouring to find some reason for this$
reticence on the subject of her age, and then added:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have not seen her. Madame is a widow,M-bM-^@M-^] he went on. M-bM-^@M-^\Alas! there are$
so many in France as the result of the terrible war.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Then she is young,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\They didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt send old men to the$
front.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\She may be young,M-bM-^@M-^] replied the agent, M-bM-^@M-^\or she may be old. One does not$
know.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He called the assistant who had shown the lady the house and had taken$
the documents for her to sign. The assistant was aged sixteen, and at$
the age of sixteen most people above twenty are listed amongst the aged.$
He was certain she was a widow and very feeble, because she walked with$
a stick. She always wore a heavy black veil, even when she was in the$
garden.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Is it not natural,M-bM-^@M-^] said the house agent romantically, M-bM-^@M-^\that the madame$
who has lost all that makes life worth living should no longer desire$
the world to look upon her face?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It may be natural in Monte Carlo,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\but it is not natural$
in London.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He located the house on a large plan which the obliging agent produced,$
and went back to the hotel, firmly resolved to take the first$
opportunity of calling on Madame Serpilot and discovering what object$
she had in view when she arranged to endanger his young life.$
$
Mary was waiting for him, a little impatiently for one who had such a$
horror of gambling.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\We have to get tickets at the Bureau,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, M-bM-^@M-^\and the concierge$
says we must have special membership cards for the Cercle PrivM-CM-)e.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The tickets were easy to procure, and they passed into the great saloon$
where, around five tables, stood silent ovals of humanity. The scene was$
a weird one to Timothy and fascinating too. Besides this, all the other$
gambling games in the world, all the roulette tables and baccara$
outfits, were crude and amateurish. The eight croupiers who sat at each$
table in their black frock coats and their black ties, solemn visaged,$
unemotional, might have been deacons in committee. The click of rakes$
against chips, the whirr of the twirling ball, the monotonous sing-song$
announcement of the chief croupierM-bM-^@M-^Tit was a ritual and a business at$
one and the same time.$
$
It was amazing to reflect that, year in and year out, from ten oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock$
in the morning until ten oM-bM-^@M-^Yclock at night (until midnight in the Cercle$
PrivM-CM-)e) these black-coated men sat at their tables, twirling their$
rakes, watching without error every note or counter that fell on the$
table, separating notes from chips with a deftness that was amazing,$
doing this in such an atmosphere of respectability that the most rabid$
anti-gambler watching the scene must come in time to believe that$
roulette was a legitimate business exercise.$
$
Through the years this fringe of people about the table would remain,$
though units would go out, and as units went out new units would replace$
them, and everlastingly would sit shabby old men and women with their$
cryptic notebooks, making their tableaux with red and black pencils,$
religiously recording the result of every coup, staking now and again$
their five-franc pieces, and watching them raked to the croupier with$
stony despair or drawing with trembling hands the few poor francs which$
fortune had sent them.$
$
Timothy was very silent when they passed the portals of the Cercle$
PrivM-CM-)e, into that wonderful interior which, viewed from the entrance$
room, had the appearance of some rich cathedral.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What do you think of them?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Mary.$
$
He did not answer at once.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What did you think of the people?M-bM-^@M-^] she demanded again. M-bM-^@M-^\Did you see$
that quaint old womanM-bM-^@M-^Ttaking a chance? IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sorry,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quickly, M-bM-^@M-^\I$
really didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt mean to beM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know you didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, and sighed.$
$
The roulette table did not attract him. He strolled off to watch the$
players at _trente et quarante_. Here the procedure was more$
complicated. One of the officials dealt two lines of cards, ending each$
when the pips added to something over thirty. The top line stood for$
black, the lower line for red, and that which was nearest to thirty won.$
After mastering this, the process was simple; you could either back the$
red or the black, or you could bet that the first card that was dealt$
was identical with the colour that won, or was the reverse.$
$
The game interested him. It had certain features which in a way were$
fascinating. He noticed that the croupier never spoke of the black. The$
black might have had no existence at the _trente et quarante_ table;$
either M-bM-^@M-^\red wonM-bM-^@M-^] or M-bM-^@M-^\red lost.M-bM-^@M-^] He staked a louis and won twice. He$
staked another and lost it. Then he won three coups of a louis and$
looked around uncertainly, almost guiltily, for Mary.$
$
She was watching the roulette players, and Timothy took a wad of bills$
from his pocket and counted out six milles. That was another thing he$
was to discover: there were three classes of playersM-bM-^@M-^Tthose who punted$
in one or five louis pieces, those who bet handsomely in milles (a$
thousand-franc note is a M-bM-^@M-^\milleM-bM-^@M-^] and has no other name), and those who$
went the maximum of twelve thousand francs on each coup.$
$
Money had no value. He threw six thousand down to the croupier and$
received in exchange six oblong plaques like thin cakes of blue soap. He$
put a thousand francs on the black and lost it. He looked round$
apprehensively for Mary, but she was still intent upon the roulette$
players. He ventured another thousand, and lost that too. A young$
Englishman sitting at the table looked up with a smile.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yre betting against the tableau,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\The table is running red$
to-night. Look!M-bM-^@M-^] He showed a little notebook ruled into divisions, and$
long lines of dots, one under the other. M-bM-^@M-^\You see,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\all these$
are reds. The table has only swung across to black twice for any run,$
and then it was only a run of four. If you bet against the table youM-bM-^@M-^Yll$
go broke.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
At any other place than at the tables at Monte Carlo advice of this$
character, and intimate references to financial possibilities, would be$
resented. But the Rooms, like the grave, level all the players, who are$
a great family banded together in an unrecognised brotherhood for the$
destruction of a common enemy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Yll take a chance against the table,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\and I shall go$
broke, anyway.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The Englishman laughed.$
$
The four thousand francs he had left went the same way as their friends$
and Timothy changed another six thousand and threw two on the black.$
Then, acting on the impulse of the moment, he threw down the remaining$
four.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Timothy!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He turned at the shocked voice and Mary was standing behind him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you gamble like that?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
He tried to smile, but produced a grimace.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Why, it is nothing,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\it is only francs, and francs arenM-bM-^@M-^Yt$
real money, anyway.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She turned and walked away and he followed. The Englishman, twisting$
round in his chair, said something. Timothy thought he was asking$
whether he should look after his money and answered M-bM-^@M-^\Certainly.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The girl walked to one of the padded benches by the wall and sat down.$
There was such real trouble in her face that TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys heart sank.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym sorry, Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\but this is my last fling and you told me I$
could have it. After to-night I cut out everything that doesnM-bM-^@M-^Yt qualify$
for the M-bM-^@M-^Xearned incomeM-bM-^@M-^Y column of the tax-surveyor.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You frighten me,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\It isnM-bM-^@M-^Yt the amount of money you were$
venturing, but there was something in your face which made me feelM-bM-^@M-^Twhy!$
I just felt sick,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Mary!M-bM-^@M-^] he said in surprise.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know IM-bM-^@M-^Ym being unreasonable,M-bM-^@M-^] she interrupted, M-bM-^@M-^\but Timothy, IM-bM-^@M-^TI$
just donM-bM-^@M-^Yt want to think of you like this.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She looked into his dejected face and the softest light that ever shone$
in womanM-bM-^@M-^Ys eyes was in hers.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!M-bM-^@M-^] she said, half in jest, M-bM-^@M-^\youM-bM-^@M-^Yre paying the penalty for$
having a girl friend.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym paying the penalty for being a loafer,M-bM-^@M-^] he said huskily. M-bM-^@M-^\I think$
there must be some bad blood in us. Mary, I know what IM-bM-^@M-^Ym losing,M-bM-^@M-^] he$
said, and took one of her hands. M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym losing the right to love you,$
dearest.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was a queer place for such a confession, and in her wildest dreams$
the girl never imagined that the first word of love spoken to her by any$
man would come in a gambling saloon at Monte Carlo. Above her where she$
sat was the great canvas of the Florentine Graces; half nude reliefs on$
the ceiling dangled glittering chains of light and over all sounded the$
monotonous voice of the croupier:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Rouge perdM-bM-^@M-^Tet couleur.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The young Englishman at the table turned round with an inquiring lift of$
his eyebrows, and Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He wants to know if IM-bM-^@M-^Ym finished, I suppose,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and honestly$
Mary, I am. IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going back to London when this tripM-bM-^@M-^Ys over, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\Poor Timothy!M-bM-^@M-^] she said again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not going to lie to you, or pretend any longer. I just love you,$
Mary, and if youM-bM-^@M-^Yll wait for me, IM-bM-^@M-^Yll make good. I have been a gambler,M-bM-^@M-^]$
he said, M-bM-^@M-^\a poor, low gambler, and all the time IM-bM-^@M-^Yve thought IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been$
clever! IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been going round puffed up with my own self-importance, and$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\I know you are, Timothy, but you neednM-bM-^@M-^Yt start at the bottom. I have my$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\Stop where you are, Mary,M-bM-^@M-^] he said quietly. M-bM-^@M-^\Not a penny would I take$
from you, darling.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What did they ring that bell for?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
It was the second time the tinkle of sound had come from the croupier at$
the _trente et quarante_ table.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Heaven knows!M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Maybe it is to call the other$
worshippers.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Again the young Englishman looked round and said something.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What did he say?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He said seventeen,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\Was that the number you backed?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy smiled.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\There are no numbers on that table except No. 1M-bM-^@M-^Tand No. 1 is the fat$

you one question: If I make good will you marry me?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was silent and again the voice of the croupier came:$
$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\What does M-bM-^@M-^Xrouge perdM-bM-^@M-^Y mean?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked. M-bM-^@M-^\He has said that ever so many$

$
M-bM-^@M-^\It means M-bM-^@M-^Xblack wins,M-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Does black always win?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not always,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy gently. M-bM-^@M-^\Maybe heM-bM-^@M-^Ys only saying that to lure$
me back to the table. Mary, what do you say?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I say yes,M-bM-^@M-^] she said, and to the scandal of the one attendant who was$
watching them he bent forward and kissed her.$
$
A terrible act this, for the gold-laced and liveried footman, who came$
with slow, majestic steps to where they sat.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Monsieur,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\this is not done.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy looked up at him.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\_Chassez-vous_,M-bM-^@M-^] he said firmly.$
$
It was startling French, but it was the nearest he could get at the$
moment to M-bM-^@M-^\chase yourself.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Again the bell tinkled, and the young Englishman rose, thrust a small$
packet of money into his pocket and came toward them, bearing what$
looked to be a large book without covers. His face was a little haggard$
and the perspiration stood upon his forehead.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\This is getting on my nerves, old man. You had better play yourself,M-bM-^@M-^]$
he said, and he handed the book to Timothy, and Timothy looked vaguely$
from his hands to the hot Englishman.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\WhatM-bM-^@M-^Ys this?M-bM-^@M-^] he croaked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\A run of twenty-eight on the black,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Englishman. M-bM-^@M-^\It is$
phenomenal! You wanted me to go on, didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt you? I asked you whether I$
should play your thousand francs. The bank bust four timesM-bM-^@M-^TdidnM-bM-^@M-^Yt you$

$
Timothy nodded. He had no words.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, your six went to twelve and I left the maximum run,M-bM-^@M-^] the$
Englishman said. M-bM-^@M-^\I asked you if that was right and you nodded.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, I nodded,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy mechanically.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yve won twenty-seven and a half maximums.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy looked at the money in his hand, looked up at the ceiling and$
gulped something down.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Thank you,M-bM-^@M-^] he gasped. M-bM-^@M-^\I am obliged to you.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was inadequate, but it was all that he could say.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Not at all,M-bM-^@M-^] said the Englishman. M-bM-^@M-^\I won a lot of money myself.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym not a great hand at arithmetic,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\will you tell me$
how many pounds twenty-seven and a half maximums make?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was a remarkable situation. Somebody should have laughed, but they$
were all too serious, the girl as serious as Timothy, and the young$

$
They stood together watching his lanky figure, as he, wholly unconscious$
of the providential part he had played, moved down to the roulette$
table, eyeing the game with the air of superiority which every player of$
_trente et quarante_ has for a game with a paltry maximum of six$
thousand francs.$

                               CHAPTER XX$
$
$
THE band was playing one of de CourvilleM-bM-^@M-^Ys new revue tunes, and the$
CafM-CM-) de Paris was crowded out. There had been a big influx of visitors$
from Nice, and Monte Carlo presented an appearance comparable with the$
height of the season. Mrs. Renfrew had motored up to La Turbie, and a$
bank of cloud having descended upon the mountain made the road$
dangerous. (Those who have journeyed from the Corniche to Monte Carlo by$
night will appreciate just how dangerous is that road.) She had,$
therefore, elected to spend the night at the hotel on the top of the$
hill.$
$
This information she had telephoned to the girl on the night following$
TimothyM-bM-^@M-^Ys great win, and had added that she could see M-bM-^@M-^\the twinkling$
lights of Monte CarloM-bM-^@M-^] and that M-bM-^@M-^\the misty spaces of ocean filled her$
with strange unrest,M-bM-^@M-^] which observation had been repeated to the$
unsympathetic Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It must be awful to have a mind like that,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, and then, M-bM-^@M-^\Mary,$
IM-bM-^@M-^Yve been a long time waiting to exchange confidences about cousins.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have no confidences to give you about Mrs. Renfrew,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mary with a$
smile, M-bM-^@M-^\but you have been on the point of telling me about your cousin$
so often that I feel a little curious.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The story he had to tell was not a nice one. It meant opening old wounds$
and reviving sad memories, but it had to be done. She was not so shocked$
as he had expected.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You have not told me anything new,M-bM-^@M-^] she said quietly. M-bM-^@M-^\You see, all$
along I have known that the M-bM-^@M-^XA.C.M-bM-^@M-^Y in your name stood for M-bM-^@M-^XAlfred$
Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^Y and once uncle told me that he had known a relative of$
yours, and I guessed.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Suddenly she demanded:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Do you think Cartwright is in Europe?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I am certain. That is, if Morocco is in Europe,M-bM-^@M-^] he said. M-bM-^@M-^\I have had$
it in the back of my mind ever since the crime was committed that that$
is the place he would make for. You see, in the few minutes I had with$
him he told me, perhaps not the whole of the story, but at any rate his$
version. He knows Morocco and has been there before. He spoke about a$
Moorish chief named El Mograb, who wanted him to stay with the tribe,$
and he told me he was sorry he had not followed the MoorM-bM-^@M-^Ys advice.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Did you tell the police that?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked.$
$
He shook his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I did not tell the police very much about that visit. Cartwright$
revived his accusations against Sir John. It meant digging up these$
charges, and that is what I did not wish to do, forM-bM-^@M-^TforM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\For my sake?M-bM-^@M-^] she said quietly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\ThatM-bM-^@M-^Ys about the size of it,M-bM-^@M-^] replied Timothy.$
$
A little stream of diners were leaving the restaurant, moving slowly$
down the narrow aisle between the tables, and Timothy stopped talking as$
they passed and eyed them with a bored interest usual to the$
circumstances.$
$
It was after the interruption had ended, and the last of the little$
stream had departed, that he saw the card on the table. It was near his$
place and it had not been there before. He picked it up and on the$
uppermost side was written: M-bM-^@M-^\Do not let your friend see this.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Well, IM-bM-^@M-^YmM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^] he began, and turned the card over.$
$
It was not written but printed in capital letters:$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\IF YOU DO NOT HEAR FROM ME BY THE TWENTY-NINTH, I BEG OF YOU$
    THAT YOU WILL GO TO TANGIER AND ENQUIRE AT THE CONTINENTAL HOTEL$
    FOR A MAN CALLED RAHBATM-bM-^@M-^TA MOOR, WHO WILL LEAD YOU TO ME. I BEG$
    YOU FOR THE SAKE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO COME. DID YOU GET THE$
    MONEY?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy laid the card down and stared at the girl.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\What is it?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked and reached out her hand.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Tit is nothing,M-bM-^@M-^] he said hurriedly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Nonsense, Timothy. What is it? Let me see it, please.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Without a word he handed the card to the girl, who read it through in$
silence.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who is that from?M-bM-^@M-^] she asked, M-bM-^@M-^\Cartwright?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He nodded.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Obviously,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\the reference to the money and the appeal to our$
relationshipM-bM-^@M-^Tbut how did it get there?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He called the head waiter.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Who were those people who went out just now?M-bM-^@M-^] he asked.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\They are very well known,M-bM-^@M-^] explained the head waiter. M-bM-^@M-^\There was a$
monsieur, a London theatrical manager, and a madame who was his wife.$
There was another monsieur, an American writer, and an English monsieur$
who was in the employment as secretary to a madame who lives at Cap$
Martin.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Madame Serpilot?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy quickly.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, that is the name. She is a widow, _hM-CM-)las_! but immensely rich!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy put the card into his pocket. He had said nothing to the girl$
about Madame Serpilot since they had left London, and for the first time$
he had some misgivings as to her safety. Yet in truth that sixth sense$
of his, which had hitherto worked so to his advantage, offered him no$
warning that the girlM-bM-^@M-^Ys happiness was threatened. He was sure that$
whatever danger the situation held was danger to him personally. He had$
not seen the English monsieur who was secretary to Madame Serpilot, but$
then his back had been toward the far end of the room from whence the$
man came and he had presented no other view than the back of his head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is a message from Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and I am going to get to$
the bottom of this story if I stay in Monte Carlo for the rest of my$
life.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He saw Mary back to her hotel, went to his room and changed, and just as$
the Casino was disgorging its tired clients, he walked through the$
palm-shaded avenue that led to the main road and began his tramp to Cap$
Martin. To discover a house in this area by daylight, with the aid of a$
plan, might have been a simple matterM-bM-^@M-^Tby night it presented almost$
insuperable difficulties.$
$
Cap Martin is a promontory of hill and pine and wild flower. Its roads$
run at the will of its wealthy residents, and there are lanes and paths$
and broad roads which are not really broad roads at all, but the private$
entrances to the wonderful villas in which the district abounds, and the$
grey light was in the eastern sky when Timothy finally located the Villa$
Condamine.$
$
It stood on the edge of the sea, surrounded on the land side by a high$
wall, though if its owner sought seclusion the woods which surrounded$
the villa were sufficient.$
$
Timothy worked round a little bay until he commanded a view of the place$
from the sea. A zig-zag path led down from the house to the seashore,$
terminating in a little concrete quay. Presently he heard the sound of$
footsteps and a Monogasque workman, in blue overalls, came slouching$
along the shore path, pipe in mouth.$
$
He bade the young man a cheery good morning and stopped, in the friendly$
way of the Monogasques, to talk. He was a gardener on his way to the$
villa. He could be on his way to nowhere else, for the rough path on$
which Timothy stood led straight to a door in the high wall. It was a$
good job, but he wished he lived nearer. But then, none of madameM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
servants slept in the house, andM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^T$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Ah! _voilM-CM- !_ It is the Moor!M-bM-^@M-^] and he pointed out to sea.$
$
A tiny steam yacht was coming slowly to landM-bM-^@M-^TTimothy had seen its$
lights for an hourM-bM-^@M-^Tand was steaming now to its anchorage, leaving the$
line of its wake on the smooth surface of the water.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\The Moor!M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy quickly, and then carelessly, M-bM-^@M-^\Has any Moor a$
villa here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, monsieur,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man, M-bM-^@M-^\but this is a great Moor who sometimes$
comes here from Morocco. A long journey, monsieur. It is five daysM-bM-^@M-^Y$
voyage from the Moorish coastM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Does he come to the Villa Condamine?M-bM-^@M-^] asked Timothy.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\But yes,M-bM-^@M-^] said the man. M-bM-^@M-^\He is a friend of the madame, and twice has he$
been there in three months.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
There was a little splash of water under the bow of the yacht, when the$
anchor was dropped, and presently a boat drew away and in the stern$
sheets was a figure muffled in a white jellab.$
$
Timothy looked after the retreating figure of the gardener, who was$
leisurely pursuing his way, and, turning, followed him. It was unlikely$
that the mysterious madame would allow a humble workman to have the key$
of the garden gate, yet to his surprise this was the case. The man$
opened the gate and waited, looking round as if he expected somebody.$
Timothy guessed that there were two or more workmen and that this$
particular man had the key and admitted the lot. In this surmise he$
proved to be right. Presently yet another blue-bloused gardener$
appeared, and the two stood together waiting for a third. He made no$
appearance, and the two men passed through the door and pulled it close$
behind them.$
$
Timothy quickened his pace. As he had thought, the door was left ajar$
for the third man. He pushed it open gently, but saw nothing but the end$
of a twisting path, which disappeared between high hedges of lilac.$
$
If ever there was a time to take a chance it was now; and he was through$
the gate, gingerly treading the path, before he realised what he had$
done. He heard voices and moved with caution. Then, after about five$
minutes, he heard the garden gate behind him bang. The third workman had$
arrived and the exit was closed. He made his way through the pines which$
served to screen the house from observation. There was nobody in sight,$
and the voices had died away. He could walk more boldly now and came at$
last to the edge of the wood in full view of the villa. Between him and$
the house was about fifty yards of clear space. He took a chance and$
crossed it, his objective being a ground-floor window which was open.$
$
The entrance was not so easily effected as he had expected. The sill of$
the window was just above the level of his head, and offered no grip to$
his hands. He made a tour of reconnaissance, but failed to find any$
other entrance. Behind the sill, he thought, must be a window frame, and$
stepping back two paces he made a leap and gripped the frame. Quickly he$
pulled himself up and dropped into the room.$
$
He was conscious of a sweet, fragrant perfume the moment his head became$
level with the window, and now he saw the explanation. The bare floor$
was covered three inches thick with rose petals. Evidently the owner$
made her own perfumery, and this hobby explained the open window. There$
was no furniture in the room, which was apparently given up to the$
purpose of drying the petals. The door was unfastened, and he passed$
into a stone corridor. The structure of the house puzzled him. He did$
not expect to find himself in the basement; then he remembered that the$
villa was built on sloping ground, and that the main entrance must be on$
a higher floor.$
$
A flight of stone steps led to the upper level, and he went up$
cautiously, a step at a time, and found his exit barred by a door which$
was fastened on the other side with padlock and staple. It was a$
primitive method of locking up a cellar, and Timothy, remembering that$
he had passed a recess filled with garden tools, went back to find the$
means to remove this obstruction. A long chisel prised the staples from$
the door with ridiculous ease.$
$
He heard voices speaking in low, guarded tones and moved along the$
carpeted hall on tiptoe. He listened at the door of the room from which$
the voices proceeded, and was in two minds as to what his next step$
should be. The door was one of two let in the same wall. He stopped and$
brought his ear to the keyhole of the second and there was no sound.$
Turning the handle, he looked in.$
$
As he expected, it was separated from the other room by a pair of$
folding doors which were closed. The voices were more distinct but still$
indistinguishable. He was now in a small drawing-room, well but not$
luxuriously furnished. Tall French windows led to a loggia, and, what$
was more important, on either side of these hung long velvet curtains,$
which might serve, in case of necessity, as a place of concealment.$
$
He heard the door of the next room open, and the voices proceeded along$
the passage. Then the handle of his own door turned. He had just time to$
slip behind the curtains before somebody entered. It was a woman, and at$
the sound of her voice he nearly jumped. She was speaking to somebody in$
the passage.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He has gone to his room,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\Have your breakfast. He will want$
you to go into Monte Carlo this morning.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\By daylight?M-bM-^@M-^] said the person to whom she spoke, and again Timothy$
recognised the voice.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\He would not know you with those spectacles. Besides, you had a$
moustache when you saw him before.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The man in the passage mumbled something, and Timothy heard the door of$
the room close. There was a desk, he had noticed, against the blank wall$
of the room, and it was to this she made her way. He heard the$
scratching of her pen on paper, then he walked from his place of$
concealment. Her back was to him and she did not hear him until his$
shadow fell across the table. Then, with a little cry, she leapt up.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Good morning, Lady Maxell,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
$
$
$
                              CHAPTER XXI$
$
$
SADIE MAXELL was as white as the paper on which she had been writing.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\How did you get in here?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy did not answer. He stepped round so that he was between the$
woman and the door.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Where is Cartwright?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Cartwright?M-bM-^@M-^] she repeated. M-bM-^@M-^\What do you want to know of him?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Lower your voice, if you please,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy sharply. M-bM-^@M-^\What is$
Cartwright to you?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She licked her dry lips before she spoke. Then:$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I married Cartwright or Benson in ParisM-bM-^@M-^Tyears ago,M-bM-^@M-^] she said.$
$
Timothy took a step back.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You married Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] he said incredulously. M-bM-^@M-^\That explains why you$
came away?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
She was looking at him steadily.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\If it wanted any explanationM-bM-^@M-^Tyes,M-bM-^@M-^] she said. M-bM-^@M-^\What are you going to$
do?M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going after the man you have upstairs, the fake Moor, who came into$
this house half an hour ago, and IM-bM-^@M-^Ym going to hand him to justice.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Before he knew what had happened, she gripped him by his coat with both$
hands.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\You are not going to do anything of the kind, Mr. M-bM-^@M-^XTake A ChanceM-bM-^@M-^Y$
Anderson,M-bM-^@M-^] she said between her teeth, and her voice trembled with$
passion. M-bM-^@M-^\I hated him once, but that was before I knew him. I would$
sooner see you dead as the other man died than that you should bring him$
more trouble.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Let me go,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, trying to press loose her hands.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\YouM-bM-^@M-^Yll leave this house and forget that you were ever here. Oh, you$
fool, you fool!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He had wrenched himself clear of her and flung her backward.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\I have a few words to say to your friend,M-bM-^@M-^] he said, M-bM-^@M-^\and I think youM-bM-^@M-^Yd$
better stay here whilst IM-bM-^@M-^Ym saying them. I hate having family quarrels$
in public, anyway.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
He had not heard the door open behind him and it was the M-bM-^@M-^\swishM-bM-^@M-^] of the$
loaded cane which warned him. It did not strike him fair on the head, as$
was intended, but caught him a glancing blow and he fell on his knees,$
turning his face to his attacker. He knew it was Brown even before the$
blow fell.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Shall I settle him?M-bM-^@M-^] said a voice as the stick went up again.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\No, no!M-bM-^@M-^] cried the woman, M-bM-^@M-^\for GodM-bM-^@M-^Ys sake, no!M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
It was at that moment that Timothy low-tackled his assailant. Brown$
tried to strike, but he was too late and went crashing to the floor, his$
head against the wall. He made one effort to rise, and then with a groan$
collapsed.$
$
Timothy rose, shaking himself and rubbing his bruised shoulder. Without$
a word, and with only a look at the woman, he made for the door and$
banged it in her face. His head was swimming as he made his way up the$
stairs, swaying at every step. From the broad landing at the top led$
three doors, only one of which was closed. He turned the handle and went$
in.$
$
A man was standing by the window, which overlooked the calm expanse of$
ocean, glittering in the light of the rising sun. From shoulder to heel$
he was clad in a long white mantle and a dark blue turban encircled his$
head.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Now, Cartwright,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy, M-bM-^@M-^\you and I will settle accounts.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
The man had not moved at the sound of the voice, but when Timothy had$
finished he turned.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\My God!M-bM-^@M-^] cried Timothy. M-bM-^@M-^\Sir John Maxell.M-bM-^@M-^]$

                            CHAPTER THE LAST$
$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\TIMOTHY,M-bM-^@M-^] said Mary, M-bM-^@M-^\I was just thinking about that beautiful house$
you took me to see at Cap Martin.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Were you, dear?M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy without any show of interest.$
$
They were on the cross-Channel boat and Boulogne was astern.$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\Yes,M-bM-^@M-^] said the girl. M-bM-^@M-^\Do you know, I had a feeling that you had taken$
me there to show me to somebody, some friend of yours perhaps. All the$
time I was walking about the garden I had a sense of being watched. It$
is not an uncomfortable sensation, but just that overlooked feeling one$
has sometimes. I love Monte Carlo. Do you think we shall go back there$
afterM-bM-^@M-^TafterM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^TM-bM-^@M-^]$
$
M-bM-^@M-^\It is likely,M-bM-^@M-^] said Timothy.$
$
The girl rose and went forward along the deck to get a view of a passing$
destroyer. Timothy took a letter from his pocket and read it for about$
the twentieth time. It was undated and began:$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\MY DEAR ANDERSON,M-bM-^@M-^TI cannot tell you how grateful I am to you$
    for your kindness and for the big, generous sympathy you have$
    shown me. Especially am I glad that you brought Mary so that I$
    could see her again, for I just hungered for a sight of the$
    child. WonM-bM-^@M-^Yt you please forgive Sadie? She acted without my$
    knowledge but in my interests, as she thought, in trying to keep$
    you away from Monte Carlo after she had planned to bring the$
    girl so that I could see her.$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\Yes, I killed Cartwright, but I shot him in self-defence. His$
    body lies at the bottom of a disused well in the garden of my$
    house. It is perfectly true that I had been associated in$
    business with him and that I was in his Moorish syndicate and$
    heavily involved. I was so very deeply involved at one time, and$
    so near to ruin that, deceived by some statement which had been$
    made to SadieM-bM-^@M-^Ys fortune, I made her acquaintance and married$
    her. During the past year I have never ceased to thank God that$
    I did so, for she had been the most loyal companion and friend$
    that a man could desire.$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\It was I who fired the shot through my own window. I$
    contemplated flight from Cartwright, and was manufacturing$
    evidence against him in advanceM-bM-^@M-^TGod forgive me. Sadie guessed,$
    and when she watched me drawing from the well the bag containing$
    proof that CartwrightM-bM-^@M-^Ys charge was not wholly false, she knew$
    the end was near.$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\I am perfectly happy, and spend most of my time developing my$
    property in Morocco, under the protection of El Mograb, an old$
    Moorish friend of mine, and the supreme protection of the$
    Sultan, who, as the Pretender, received considerable help from$
    me. I am six months of the year with Sadie, for Sadie either$
    lives on the Riviera or at Cadiz and is easily reachable in my$
    hired yacht.$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\I think it best for all concerned, and especially for our dear$
    Mary, that I remain as dead. Some day the whole story may be$
    told, but no useful purpose would be served by publishing it$
    to-day. The card with the message was intended for her, but I am$
    glad that it fell into your hands. As you guessed, it was I who$
    flung MaryM-bM-^@M-^Ys money into your roomM-bM-^@M-^TI dared not post it to her$
    for fear I was betrayed by my writing, and I knew that you were$
    safe. God bless you both and bring you happiness and prosperity,$
    to which I hope this property of mine will one day contribute.M-bM-^@M-^]$
$
Timothy folded the letter and was putting it in his pocket, then changed$
his mind and took it out. He read it again, then tore it into pieces and$
flung it over the side of the ship.$
$
Then he too went forward to the wife he had married in ParisM-bM-^@M-^Tmuch$
against the wishes of a scandalised Mrs. RenfrewM-bM-^@M-^Twho nevertheless$
termed it M-bM-^@M-^\a pretty romanceM-bM-^@M-^] in the article she wrote for the _Bath$

    A Wonder for$
    Wise Men$
    By$
    Wallace B. Nichols$
$
    THOUGH an historical romance, this book is much more than$
    that, for its theme touches present-day ideas in a remarkable$
    manner, especially as concerns the hideous uselessness of war.$
    It is set in the reign of Henry VII and deals with the aftermath$
    of the Wars of the Roses. The principal character becomes one of$
    the KingM-bM-^@M-^Ys most trusted instruments in the founding of modern$
    England, and the story marches to an emotional and uplifting$
    close. This is an historical novel where the characters are not$
    puppets of impossible romance, but living human beings as real$
    as the people about us every day.$

    SECRET MARKET$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\This is a first novel by one of our younger poets, and it is a$
    novel which equally plainly shows him to be an artist. The plot$
    is cleverly developed, and the story ends at once dramatically$
    and artistically.M-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^T_The Glasgow Herald._$

    BRITTLE GLORY$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\Wallace B. Nichols deserves congratulation. He has demonstrated$
    a capacity for expression, in terms of strength, beauty and$
    sincerity, through two mediums. It is an uncommon book with an$
    outstanding quality: it never ceases to be readable.M-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^T_The$

M-bM-^AM-^B   M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. Nichols has all the gifts of a great novelist: an unerring sense$
    of character, and a distinguished literary style.M-bM-^@M-^]M-bM-^@M-^T_The Referee._$

    Mr. Fortune$
    Explains$
    By$
    H. C. Bailey$
$
    M-bM-^@M-^\MR. FORTUNEM-bM-^@M-^] has long since established himself as one of the$
    brightest stars in the galaxy of modern crime detectives. He$
    works on the friendliest terms with Scotland Yard, but his$
    methodsM-bM-^@M-^Tand incidentally his mannersM-bM-^@M-^Tare peculiarly his own.$
    Here we have a series of the most widely divergent mysteries$
    successively solved by a bland, imperturbable middle-aged$
    gentleman whose sole concern in life appears to be that he shall$
    not miss his lunch or any other comfort that is due to him. No$
    one who has read other M-bM-^@M-^\Mr. FortuneM-bM-^@M-^] volumes will on any account$
    miss this, while those who have yet to make the dear manM-bM-^@M-^Ys$
    acquaintance are to be envied for the joy that awaits them.$

$
M-bM-^AM-^B   Mr. H. C. Bailey is not only a master in the realm of historic$
    romance, but in that of the mystery story as well: in fact, he is$

    By$
    Ben Bolt$
$
    ONE would think it impossible for anybody to walk down into$
    the crowded new Piccadilly Circus Tube Station and there be$
    swiftly murdered without immediate discovery of the assassin.$
    But from the slenderest of clues the whole failure of a great$
    vengeance is discovered, and Mr. Ben Bolt has provided in his$
    new story a series of situations and adventures that would keep$
    the sleepiest reader agog for the end.$

    ADMIRERS of M-bM-^@M-^\Wee MacgreegorM-bM-^@M-^] and kindred works will be$
    interested to see what the talented author makes of a more$
    ambitious theme. Subtle characterization is here combined with$
    the thrills of an Armada treasure hunt, complicated by the$
    misunderstandings and perplexities of three widely divergent$
    love affairs. The scenes are laid partly in Spain, partly in the$
    Western Isles, and what with bloodstained daggers, mysterious$
    scraps of parchment, buried caskets, plotting priests,$
    mysterious garden-haunting strangers, and speedy motor-boats,$
    the reader is kept constantly guessing.$

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate$
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other$
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or$
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or$
cannot be read by your equipment.$

Defect you cause.$
$
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm$
$
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of$
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of$
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It$
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations$
from people in all walks of life.$
$
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the$
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's$
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will$
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project$
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure$
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future$
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary$
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see$
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at$
www.gutenberg.org$

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg$
Literary Archive Foundation$
$
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide$
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of$
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be$
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest$
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations$
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt$
status with the IRS.$
$
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating$
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United$
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a$
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up$
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations$
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND$
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular$
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate$
$
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we$
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition$
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who$
approach us with offers to donate.$
$
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make$
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from$
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.$
$
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation$
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other$
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To$
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate$
$
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.$
$
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project$
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be$
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and$
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of$
volunteer support.$
$
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed$
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in$
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not$
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper$
edition.$
$
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search$
facility: www.gutenberg.org$
$
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,$
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary$
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to$
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.$
